    "Description": "This module binds to an open X11 host to log keystrokes. This is a fairly close copy of the old xspy c program which has been on Kali for a long time. The module works by connecting to the X11 session, creating a background window, binding a keyboard to it and creating a notification alert when a key is pressed. One of the major limitations of xspy, and thus this module, is that it polls at a very fast rate, faster than a key being pressed is released (especially before the repeat delay is hit). To combat printing multiple characters for a single key press, repeat characters arent printed when typed in a very fast manor. This is also an imperfect keylogger in that keystrokes arent stored and forwarded but status displayed at poll time. Keys may be repeated or missing.",
