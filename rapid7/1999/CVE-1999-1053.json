    "Title": "Matt Wright guestbook.pl Arbitrary Command Execution",
    "Description": "The Matt Wright guestbook.pl <= v2.3.1 CGI script contains a flaw that may allow arbitrary command execution. The vulnerability requires that HTML posting is enabled in the guestbook.pl script, and that the web server must have the Server-Side Include (SSI) script handler enabled for the '.html' file type. By combining the script weakness with non-default server configuration, it is possible to exploit this vulnerability successfully.",
