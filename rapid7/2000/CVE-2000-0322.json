    "Description": "This module abuses two flaws - a metacharacter injection vulnerability in the HTTP management server of RedHat 6.2 systems running the Piranha LVS cluster service and GUI (rpm packages: piranha and piranha-gui). The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the Apache user account (nobody) within the /piranha/secure/passwd.php3 script. The package installs with a default user and password of piranha:q which was exploited in the wild.",
