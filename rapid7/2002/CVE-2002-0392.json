    "Description": "This module exploits the chunked transfer integer wrap vulnerability in Apache version 1.2.x to 1.3.24. This particular module has been tested with all versions of the official Win32 build between 1.3.9 and 1.3.24. Additionally, it should work against most co-branded and bundled versions of Apache (Oracle 8i, 9i, IBM HTTPD, etc).  You will need to use the Check() functionality to determine the exact target version prior to launching the exploit. The version of Apache bundled with Oracle 8.1.7 will not automatically restart, so if you use the wrong target value, the server will crash.",
