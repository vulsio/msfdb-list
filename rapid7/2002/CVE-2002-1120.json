    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Savant 3.1 Web Server. The service supports a maximum of 10 threads (for a default install). Each exploit attempt generally causes a thread to die whether successful or not. Therefore, in a default configuration, you only have 10 chances. Due to the limited space available for the payload in this exploit module, use of the \"ord\" payloads is recommended.",
