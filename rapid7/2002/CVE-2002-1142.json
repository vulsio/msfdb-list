    "Description": "This module can be used to execute arbitrary code on IIS servers that expose the /msadc/msadcs.dll Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) Remote Data Service (RDS) DataFactory service. The service is exploitable even when RDS is configured to deny remote connections (handsafe.reg). The service is vulnerable to a heap overflow where the RDS DataStub 'Content-Type' string is overly long. Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.1 through 2.6 are known to be vulnerable.",
