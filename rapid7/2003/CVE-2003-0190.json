    "Title": "SSH Username Enumeration",
    "Description": "This module uses a malformed packet or timing attack to enumerate users on an OpenSSH server.  The default action sends a malformed (corrupted) SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packet using public key authentication (must be enabled) to enumerate users.  On some versions of OpenSSH under some configurations, OpenSSH will return a \"permission denied\" error for an invalid user faster than for a valid user, creating an opportunity for a timing attack to enumerate users.  Testing note: invalid users were logged, while valid users were not. YMMV.",
