    "Title": "Poptop Negative Read Overflow",
    "Description": "This is an exploit for the Poptop negative read overflow.  This will work against versions prior to 1.1.3-b3 and 1.1.3-20030409, but I currently do not have a good way to detect Poptop versions.  The server will by default only allow 4 concurrent manager processes (what we run our code in), so you could have a max of 4 shells at once.  Using the current method of exploitation, our socket will be closed before we have the ability to run code, preventing the use of Findsock.",
