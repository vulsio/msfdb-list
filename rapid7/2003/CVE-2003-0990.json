This flaw was found while quickly grepping the code after release of some information at http://www.wslabi.com/. Later, iDefense published an advisory .... Reading an email in SquirrelMail with the PGP plugin activated is enough to compromise the underlying server. Only \"cmd/unix/generic\" payloads were tested.",
