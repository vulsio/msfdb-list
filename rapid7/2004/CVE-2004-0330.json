    "Title": "Serv-U FTPD MDTM Overflow",
    "Description": "This is an exploit for the Serv-U\\'s MDTM command timezone overflow. It has been heavily tested against versions 4.0.0.4/4.1.0.0/4.1.0.3/5.0.0.0 with success against nt4/2k/xp/2k3. I have also had success against version 3, but only tested 1 version/os. The bug is in all versions prior to 5.0.0.4, but this exploit will not work against versions not listed above. You only get one shot, but it should be OS/SP independent. This exploit is a single hit, the service dies after the shellcode finishes execution.",
