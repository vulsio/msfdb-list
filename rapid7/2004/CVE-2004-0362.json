    "Title": "ISS PAM.dll ICQ Parser Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the ISS products that use the iss-pam1.dll ICQ parser (Blackice/RealSecure). Successful exploitation will result in arbitrary code execution as LocalSystem. This exploit only requires 1 UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address.  The ISS exception handler will recover the process after each overflow, giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.",
