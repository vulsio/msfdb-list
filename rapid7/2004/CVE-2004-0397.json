    "Description": "This is an exploit for the Subversion date parsing overflow.  This exploit is for the svnserve daemon (svn:// protocol) and will not work for Subversion over webdav (http[s]://).  This exploit should never crash the daemon, and should be safe to do multi-hits.  **WARNING** This exploit seems to (not very often, I've only seen it during testing) corrupt the subversion database, so be careful!",
