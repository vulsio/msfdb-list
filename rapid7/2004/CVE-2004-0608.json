    "Description": "This is an exploit for the GameSpy secure query in the Unreal Engine. This exploit only requires one UDP packet, which can be both spoofed and sent to a broadcast address. Usually, the GameSpy query server listens on port 7787, but you can manually specify the port as well. The RunServer.sh script will automatically restart the server upon a crash, giving us the ability to bruteforce the service and exploit it multiple times.",
