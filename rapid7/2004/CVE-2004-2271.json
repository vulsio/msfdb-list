    "Title": "Minishare 1.4.1 Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This is a simple buffer overflow for the minishare web server. This flaw affects all versions prior to 1.4.2. This is a plain stack buffer overflow that requires a \"jmp esp\" to reach the payload, making this difficult to target many platforms at once. This module has been successfully tested against 1.4.1. Version 1.3.4 and below do not seem to be vulnerable.",
