    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the RPC interface to the Microsoft Message Queueing service. The offset to the return address changes based on the length of the system hostname, so this must be provided via the 'HNAME' option. Much thanks to snort.org and Jean-Baptiste Marchand's excellent MSRPC website.",
