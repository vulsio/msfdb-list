    "Title": "Microsoft Plug and Play Service Registry Overflow",
    "Description": "This module triggers a stack buffer overflow in the Windows Plug and Play service. This vulnerability can be exploited on Windows 2000 without a valid user account. Since the PnP service runs inside the service.exe process, this module will result in a forced reboot on Windows 2000. Obtaining code execution is possible if user-controlled memory can be placed at 0x00000030, 0x0030005C, or 0x005C005C.",
