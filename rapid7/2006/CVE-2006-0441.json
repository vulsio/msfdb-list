    "Title": "KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server v2.02 USER Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits the KarjaSoft Sami FTP Server version 2.02 by sending an excessively long USER string. The stack is overwritten when the administrator attempts to view the FTP logs. Therefore, this exploit is passive and requires end-user interaction. Keep this in mind when selecting payloads. When the server is restarted, it will re-execute the exploit until the logfile is manually deleted via the file system.",
