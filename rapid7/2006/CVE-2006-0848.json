    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Safari's \"Safe file\" feature, which will automatically open any file with one of the allowed extensions. This can be abused by supplying a zip file, containing a shell script, with a metafile indicating that the file should be opened by Terminal.app. This module depends on the 'zip' command-line utility.",
