    "Title": "Novell Messenger Server 2.0 Accept-Language Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise Messenger Server v2.0. This flaw is triggered by any HTTP request with an Accept-Language header greater than 16 bytes. To overwrite the return address on the stack, we must first pass a memcpy() operation that uses pointers we supply. Due to the large list of restricted characters and the limitations of the current encoder modules, very few payloads are usable.",
