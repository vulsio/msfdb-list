    "Title": "Cyrus IMAPD pop3d popsubfolders USER Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This exploit takes advantage of a stack based overflow.  Once the stack corruption has occurred it is possible to overwrite a pointer which is later used for a memcpy. This gives us a write anything anywhere condition similar to a format string vulnerability. NOTE: The popsubfolders option is a non-default setting. I chose to overwrite the GOT with my shellcode and return to it. This defeats the VA random patch and possibly other stack protection features. Tested on gentoo-sources Linux 2.6.16. Although Fedora CORE 5 ships with a version containing the vulnerable code, it is not exploitable due to the use of the FORTIFY_SOURCE compiler enhancement.",
