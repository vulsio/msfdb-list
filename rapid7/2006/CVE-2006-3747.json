    "Title": "Apache Module mod_rewrite LDAP Protocol Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits the mod_rewrite LDAP protocol scheme handling flaw discovered by Mark Dowd, which produces an off-by-one overflow. Apache versions 1.3.29-36, 2.0.47-58, and 2.2.1-2 are vulnerable. This module requires REWRITEPATH to be set accurately. In addition, the target must have 'RewriteEngine on' configured, with a specific 'RewriteRule' condition enabled to allow for exploitation.  The flaw affects multiple platforms, however this module currently only supports Windows based installations.",
