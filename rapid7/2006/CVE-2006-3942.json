    "Title": "Microsoft SRV.SYS Mailslot Write Corruption",
    "Description": "This module triggers a kernel pool corruption bug in SRV.SYS. Each call to the mailslot write function results in a two byte return value being written into the response packet. The code which creates this packet fails to consider these two bytes in the allocation routine, resulting in a slow corruption of the kernel memory pool. These two bytes are almost always set to \"\\xff\\xff\" (a short integer with value of -1).",
