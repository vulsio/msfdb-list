    "Title": "UltraISO CUE File Parsing Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in EZB Systems, Inc's UltraISO. When processing .CUE files, data is read from file into a fixed-size stack buffer. Since no bounds checking is done, a buffer overflow can occur. Attackers can execute arbitrary code by convincing their victim to open an CUE file. NOTE: A file with the same base name, but the extension of \"bin\" must also exist. Opening either file will trigger the vulnerability, but the files must both exist.",
