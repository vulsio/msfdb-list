    "Title": "DVD X Player 5.5 .plf PlayList Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow on DVD X Player 5.5 Pro and Standard.  By supplying a long string of data in a plf file (playlist), the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component will attempt to extract a filename out of the string, and then copy it on the stack without any proper bounds checking, which causes a buffer overflow, and results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.  This module has been designed to target common Windows systems such as: Windows XP SP2/SP3, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.",
