    "Title": "TFTP Server for Windows 1.4 ST WRQ Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in TFTP Server 1.4 ST.  The flaw is due to the way TFTP handles the filename parameter extracted from a WRQ request. The server will append the user-supplied filename to TFTP server binary's path without any bounds checking, and then attempt to check this path with a fopen(). Since this isn't a valid file path, fopen() returns null, which allows the corrupted data to be used in a strcmp() function, causing an access violation.  Since the offset is sensitive to how the TFTP server is launched, you must know in advance if your victim machine launched the TFTP as a 'Service' or 'Standalone' , and then manually select your target accordingly. A successful attempt will lead to remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM if run as a service, or the user if run as a standalone. A failed attempt will result a denial-of-service.",
