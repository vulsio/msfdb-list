    "Title": "OpenTFTP SP 1.4 Error Packet Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4.  The vulnerable condition triggers when the TFTP opcode is configured as an error packet, the TFTP service will then format the message using a sprintf() function, which causes an overflow, therefore allowing remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.  The offset (to EIP) is specific to how the TFTP was started (as a 'Stand Alone', or 'Service').  By default the target is set to 'Service' because that's the default configuration during OpenTFTP Server SP 1.4's installation.",
