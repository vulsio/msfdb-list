    "Title": "Oracle Weblogic Apache Connector POST Request Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in the BEA Weblogic Apache plugin. The connector fails to properly handle specially crafted HTTP POST requests, resulting a buffer overflow due to the insecure usage of sprintf.  Currently, this module works over Windows systems without DEP, and has been tested with Windows 2000 / XP. In addition, the Weblogic Apache plugin version is fingerprinted with a POST request containing a specially crafted Transfer-Encoding header.",
