    "Title": "Ultra Shareware Office Control ActiveX HttpUpload Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Ultra Shareware's Office Control. When processing the 'HttpUpload' method, the arguments are concatenated together to form a command line to run a bundled version of cURL. If the command fails to run, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs when building the error message. This is due to the use of sprintf() without proper bounds checking.  NOTE: Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the payload into memory unmodified.",
