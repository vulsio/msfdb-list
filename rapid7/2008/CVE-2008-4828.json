    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express Remote Client Agent service. By sending a \"dicuGetIdentify\" request packet containing a long NodeName parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code.  NOTE: this exploit first connects to the CAD service to start the RCA service and obtain the port number on which it runs. This service does not restart.",
