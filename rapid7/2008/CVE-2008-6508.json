    "Title": "Openfire Admin Console Authentication Bypass",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the administration console of Openfire servers. By using this vulnerability it is possible to upload/execute a malicious Openfire plugin on the server and execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested against Openfire 3.6.0a. It is possible to remove the uploaded plugin after execution, however this might turn the server in some kind of unstable state, making re-exploitation difficult. You might want to do this manually.",
