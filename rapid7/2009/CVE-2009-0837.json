    "Title": "Foxit Reader 3.0 Open Execute Action Stack Based Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in Foxit Reader 3.0 builds 1301 and earlier. Due to the way Foxit Reader handles the input from an \"Launch\" action, it is possible to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
