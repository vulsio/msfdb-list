    "Title": "IBM System Director Agent DLL Injection",
    "Description": "This module abuses the \"wmicimsv\" service on IBM System Director Agent 5.20.3 to accomplish arbitrary DLL injection and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In order to accomplish remote DLL injection it uses a WebDAV service as disclosed by kingcope on December 2012. Because of this, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on Windows XP SP3, but disabled by default on Windows 2003 SP2.",
