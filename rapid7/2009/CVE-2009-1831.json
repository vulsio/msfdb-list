    "Title": "Winamp MAKI Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Winamp 5.55. The flaw exists in the gen_ff.dll and occurs while parsing a specially crafted MAKI file, where memmove is used in an insecure way with user controlled data.  To exploit the vulnerability the attacker must convince the victim to install the generated mcvcore.maki file in the \"scripts\" directory of the default \"Bento\" skin, or generate a new skin using the crafted mcvcore.maki file. The module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.",
