    "Title": "Green Dam URL Processing Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in Green Dam Youth Escort version 3.17 in the way it handles overly long URLs. By setting an overly long URL, an attacker can overrun a buffer and execute arbitrary code. This module uses the .NET DLL memory technique by Alexander Sotirov and Mark Dowd and should bypass DEP, NX and ASLR.",
