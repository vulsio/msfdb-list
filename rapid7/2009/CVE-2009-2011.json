    "Description": "This module exploits a command execution vulnerability within the DX Studio Player from Worldweaver for versions 3.0.29 and earlier. The player is a browser plugin for IE (ActiveX) and Firefox (dll). When an unsuspecting user visits a web page referring to a specially crafted .dxstudio document, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands. Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.0.29.0 for Firefox 2.0.0.20 and IE 6 on Windows XP SP3. In IE, the user will be prompted if they wish to allow the plug-in to access local files. This prompt appears to occur only once per server host. NOTE: This exploit uses additionally dangerous script features to write to local files!",
