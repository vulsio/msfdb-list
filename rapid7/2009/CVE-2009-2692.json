    "Title": "Linux Kernel Sendpage Local Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "The Linux kernel failed to properly initialize some entries in the proto_ops struct for several protocols, leading to NULL being dereferenced and used as a function pointer. By using mmap(2) to map page 0, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.  Several public exploits exist for this vulnerability, including spender's wunderbar_emporium and rcvalle's ppc port, sock_sendpage.c.  All Linux 2.4/2.6 versions since May 2001 are believed to be affected: 2.4.4 up to and including 2.4.37.4; 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.30.4  This module has been tested successfully on CentOS 5.0 (i386) with kernel version 2.6.18-8.1.1.tl5; and Debian 3.1r8 Sarge (i686) with kernel version 2.4.27-3-386.",
