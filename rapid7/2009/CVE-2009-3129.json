    "Title": "MS09-067 Microsoft Excel Malformed FEATHEADER Record Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the handling of the FEATHEADER record by Microsoft Excel. Revisions of Office XP and later prior to the release of the MS09-067 bulletin are vulnerable. When processing a FEATHEADER (Shared Feature) record, Microsoft used a data structure from the file to calculate a pointer offset without doing proper validation. Attacker supplied data is then used to calculate the location of an object, and in turn a virtual function call. This results in arbitrary code execution. NOTE: On some versions of Office, the user will need to dismiss a warning dialog prior to the payload executing.",
