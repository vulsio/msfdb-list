    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in opcode 21 handled by rpc.cmsd on AIX. By making a request with a long string passed to the first argument of the \"rtable_create\" RPC, a stack based buffer overflow occurs. This leads to arbitrary code execution. NOTE: Unsuccessful attempts may cause inetd/portmapper to enter a state where further attempts are not possible.",
