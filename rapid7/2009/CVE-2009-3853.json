    "Title": "IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Express CAD Service. By sending a \"ping\" packet containing a long string, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. NOTE: the dsmcad.exe service must be in a particular state (CadWaitingStatus = 1) in order for the vulnerable code to be reached. This state doesn't appear to be reachable when the TSM server is not running. This service does not restart.",
