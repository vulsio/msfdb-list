    "Title": "HP Power Manager 'formExportDataLogs' Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in HP Power Manager's 'formExportDataLogs'. By creating a malformed request specifically for the fileName parameter, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to a long error message (which contains the fileName), which may result in arbitrary remote code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'.",
