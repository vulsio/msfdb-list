    "Title": "Microsoft Windows 7 / Server 2008 R2 SMB Client Infinite Loop",
    "Description": "This module exploits a denial of service flaw in the Microsoft Windows SMB client on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. To trigger this bug, run this module as a service and forces a vulnerable client to access the IP of this system as an SMB server. This can be accomplished by embedding a UNC path (\\\\HOST\\share\\something) into a web page if the target is using Internet Explorer, or a Word document otherwise.",
