    "Title": "Sun Java System Web Server WebDAV OPTIONS Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in Sun Java Web Server prior to version 7 Update 8. By sending an \"OPTIONS\" request with an overly long path, attackers can execute arbitrary code. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the attacker must also specify the path to a directory with WebDAV enabled.  This exploit was tested and confirmed to work on Windows XP SP3 without DEP. Versions for other platforms are vulnerable as well.  The vulnerability was originally discovered and disclosed by Evgeny Legerov of Intevydis.",
