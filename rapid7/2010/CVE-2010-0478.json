    "Title": "Windows Media Services ConnectFunnel Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the Windows Media Unicast Service version 4.1.0.3930 (NUMS.exe). By sending a specially crafted FunnelConnect request, an attacker can execute arbitrary code under the \"NetShowServices\" user account. Windows Media Services 4.1 ships with Windows 2000 Server, but is not installed by default. NOTE: This service does NOT restart automatically. Successful, as well as unsuccessful exploitation attempts will kill the service which prevents additional attempts.",
