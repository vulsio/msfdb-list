    "Title": "MS10-022 Microsoft Internet Explorer Winhlp32.exe MsgBox Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a code execution vulnerability that occurs when a user presses F1 on MessageBox originated from VBscript within a web page. When the user hits F1, the MessageBox help functionality will attempt to load and use a HLP file from an SMB or WebDAV (if the WebDAV redirector is enabled) server.  This particular version of the exploit implements a WebDAV server that will serve HLP file as well as a payload EXE. During testing warnings about the payload EXE being unsigned were witnessed. A future version of this module might use other methods that do not create such a warning.",
