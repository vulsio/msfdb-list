    "Title": "Java MixerSequencer Object GM_Song Structure Handling Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a flaw within the handling of MixerSequencer objects in Java 6u18 and before.  Exploitation id done by supplying a specially crafted MIDI file within an RMF File. When the MixerSequencer objects is used to play the file, the GM_Song structure is populated with a function pointer provided by a SONG block in the RMF. A Midi block that contains a MIDI with a specially crafted controller event is used to trigger the vulnerability.  When triggering the vulnerability \"ebx\" points to a fake event in the MIDI file which stores the shellcode. A \"jmp ebx\" from msvcr71.dll is used to make the exploit reliable over java updates.",
