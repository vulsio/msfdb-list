    "Title": "Sun Java Web Start Plugin Command Line Argument Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a flaw in the Web Start plugin component of Sun Java Web Start. The arguments passed to Java Web Start are not properly validated. By passing the lesser known -J option, an attacker can pass arbitrary options directly to the Java runtime. By utilizing the -XXaltjvm option, as discussed by Ruben Santamarta, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting browser user.  This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Ruben Santamarta and Tavis Ormandy. Tavis reported that all versions since version 6 Update 10 \"are believed to be affected by this vulnerability.\"  In order for this module to work, it must be ran as root on a server that does not serve SMB. Additionally, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV Mini-Redirector) enabled.",
