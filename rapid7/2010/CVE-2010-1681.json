    "Description": "This module exploits a stack based overflow vulnerability in the handling of the DXF files by Microsoft Visio 2002. Revisions prior to the release of the MS bulletin MS10-028 are vulnerable. The overflow occurs when the application is used to import a specially crafted DXF file, while parsing the HEADER section of the DXF file. To trigger the vulnerability an attacker must convince someone to insert a specially crafted DXF file to a new document, go to 'Insert' -> 'CAD Drawing'",
