    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in FTP Synchronizer Pro version 4.0.73.274 The overflow gets triggered by sending an overly long filename to the client in response to a LIST command. The LIST command gets issued when doing a preview or when you have just created a new sync profile and allow the tool to see the differences. This will overwrite a structured exception handler and trigger an access violation.",
