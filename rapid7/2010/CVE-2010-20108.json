    "Title": "FTPPad 1.2.0 Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow FTPPad 1.2.0 ftp client. The overflow is triggered when the client connects to a FTP server which sends an overly long directory and filename in response to a LIST command. This will cause an access violation, and will eventually overwrite the saved extended instruction pointer.  Payload can be found at EDX+5c and ESI+5c, so a little pivot/ sniper was needed to make this one work.",
