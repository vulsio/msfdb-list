    "Title": "Maple Maplet File Creation and Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module harnesses Maple's ability to create files and execute commands automatically when opening a Maplet. All versions up to 13 are suspected vulnerable. Testing was conducted with version 13 on Windows. Standard security settings prevent code from running in a normal maple worksheet without user interaction, but those setting do not prevent code in a Maplet from running. In order for the payload to be executed, an attacker must convince someone to open a specially modified .maplet file with Maple. By doing so, an attacker can execute arbitrary code as the victim user.",
