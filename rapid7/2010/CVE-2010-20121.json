    "Title": "EasyFTP Server CWD Command Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in EasyFTP Server 1.7.0.11 and earlier. EasyFTP fails to check input size when parsing 'CWD' commands, which leads to a stack based buffer overflow.  EasyFTP allows anonymous access by default; valid credentials are typically unnecessary to exploit this vulnerability. After version 1.7.0.12, this package was renamed \"UplusFtp\". This exploit utilizes a small piece of code that I\\'ve referred to as 'fixRet'. This code allows us to inject of payload of ~500 bytes into a 264 byte buffer by 'fixing' the return address post-exploitation.  See references for more information.",
