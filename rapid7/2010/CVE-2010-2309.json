    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the web server provided with the EvoCam program for Mac OS X. We use Dino Dai Zovi's exec-from-heap technique to copy the payload from the non-executable stack segment to heap memory. Vulnerable versions include 3.6.6, 3.6.7, and possibly earlier versions as well. EvoCam version 3.6.8 fixes the vulnerability.",
