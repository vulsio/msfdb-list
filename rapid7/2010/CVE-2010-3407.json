    "Title": "IBM Lotus Domino iCalendar MAILTO Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in IBM Lotus Domino iCalendar.  By sending a long string of data as the \"ORGANIZER;mailto\" header, process \"nRouter.exe\" crashes due to a Cstrcpy() routine in nnotes.dll, which allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary code execution.  Note: In order to trigger the vulnerable code path, a valid Domino mailbox account is needed.",
