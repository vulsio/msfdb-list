    "Title": "MS10-104 Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in SharePoint Server 2007 SP2. The software contains a directory traversal, that allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem, sending a specially crafted SOAP ConvertFile request to the Office Document Conversions Launcher Service, which results in code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'. The module uses the Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute an arbitrary payload on vulnerable installations of SharePoint on Windows 2003 Servers. It has been successfully tested on Office SharePoint Server 2007 SP2 over Windows 2003 SP2.",
