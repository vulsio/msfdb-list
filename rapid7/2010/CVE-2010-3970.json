    "Title": "MS11-006 Microsoft Windows CreateSizedDIBSECTION Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of thumbnails within .MIC files and various Office documents. When processing a thumbnail bitmap containing a negative 'biClrUsed' value, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs. This leads to arbitrary code execution.  In order to trigger the vulnerable code, the folder containing the document must be viewed using the \"Thumbnails\" view.",
