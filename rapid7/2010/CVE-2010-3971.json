    "Title": "MS11-003 Microsoft Internet Explorer CSS Recursive Import Use After Free",
    "Description": "This module exploits a memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft\\'s HTML engine (mshtml). When parsing an HTML page containing a recursive CSS import, a C++ object is deleted and later reused. This leads to arbitrary code execution.  This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions with .NET 2.0.50727 installed.",
