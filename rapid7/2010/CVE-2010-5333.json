    "Title": "Race River Integard Home/Pro LoginAdmin Password Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in Race river's Integard Home/Pro internet content filter HTTP Server. Versions prior to 2.0.0.9037 and 2.2.0.9037 are vulnerable. The administration web page on port 18881 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow attack. By sending a long character string in the password field, both the structured exception handler and the saved extended instruction pointer are over written, allowing an attacker to gain control of the application and the underlying operating system remotely. The administration website service runs with SYSTEM privileges, and automatically restarts when it crashes.",
