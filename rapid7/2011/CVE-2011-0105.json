    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Excel of Microsoft Office 2007. By supplying a malformed .xlb file, an attacker can control the content (source) of a memcpy routine, and the number of bytes to copy, therefore causing a stack- based buffer overflow.  This results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
