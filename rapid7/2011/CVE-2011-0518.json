    "Title": "LotusCMS 3.0 eval() Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Lotus CMS 3.0's Router() function.  This is done by embedding PHP code in the 'page' parameter, which will be passed to a eval call, therefore allowing remote code execution.  The module can either automatically pick up a 'page' parameter from the default page, or manually specify one in the URI option.  To use the automatic method, please supply the URI with just a directory path, for example: \"/lcms/\". To manually configure one, you may do: \"/lcms/somepath/index.php?page=index\"",
