    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player that was discovered, and has been exploited actively in the wild.  By embedding a specially crafted .swf file, Adobe Flash crashes due to an invalid use of an object type, which allows attackers to overwrite a pointer in memory, and results arbitrary code execution. Please note for IE 8 targets, Java Runtime Environment must be available on the victim machine in order to work properly.",
