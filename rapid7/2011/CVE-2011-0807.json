    "Description": "This module attempts to login to GlassFish instance using username and password combinations indicated by the USER_FILE, PASS_FILE, and USERPASS_FILE options. It will also try to do an authentication bypass against older versions of GlassFish. Note: by default, GlassFish 4.0 requires HTTPS, which means you must set the SSL option to true, and SSLVersion to TLS1. It also needs Secure Admin to access the DAS remotely.",

    "Description": "This module logs in to a GlassFish Server (Open Source or Commercial) using various methods (such as authentication bypass, default credentials, or user-supplied login), and deploys a malicious war file in order to get remote code execution. It has been tested on Glassfish 2.x, 3.0, 4.0 and Sun Java System Application Server 9.x. Newer GlassFish versions do not allow remote access (Secure Admin) by default, but is required for exploitation.",
