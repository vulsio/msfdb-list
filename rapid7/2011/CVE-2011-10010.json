    "Title": "QuickShare File Server 1.2.1 Directory Traversal Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in QuickShare File Server's FTP service.  By supplying \"../\" in the file path, it is possible to trigger a directory traversal flaw, allowing the attacker to read a file outside the virtual directory.  By default, the \"Writable\" option is enabled during account creation, therefore this makes it possible to create a file at an arbitrary location, which leads to remote code execution.",
