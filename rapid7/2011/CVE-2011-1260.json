    "Title": "MS11-050 IE mshtml!CObjectElement Use After Free",
    "Description": "This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability occurs when an invalid <object> tag exists and other elements overlap/cover where the object tag should be when rendered (due to their styles/positioning). The mshtml!CObjectElement is then freed from memory because it is invalid. However, the mshtml!CDisplay object for the page continues to keep a reference to the freed <object> and attempts to call a function on it, leading to the use-after-free.  Please note that for IE 8 targets, JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is required to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention).",
