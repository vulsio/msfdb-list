    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in DATAC Control International RealWin SCADA Server 2.1 and below. By supplying a specially crafted On_FC_BINFILE_FCS_*FILE packet via port 910, RealWin will try to create a file (which would be saved to C:\\Program Files\\DATAC\\Real Win\\RW-version\\filename) by first copying the user- supplied filename with an inline memcpy routine without proper bounds checking, which results a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing arbitrary remote code execution.  Tested version: 2.0 (Build 6.1.8.10)",
