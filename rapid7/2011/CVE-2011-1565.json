    "Description": "This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities found on IGSS 9's Data Server and Data Collector services.  The initial approach is first by transferring our binary with Write packets (opcode 0x0D) via port 12401 (igssdataserver.exe), and then send an EXE packet (opcode 0x0A) to port 12397 (dc.exe), which will cause dc.exe to run that payload with a CreateProcessA() function as a new thread.",
