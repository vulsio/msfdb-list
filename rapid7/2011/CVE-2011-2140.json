    "Title": "Adobe Flash Player MP4 SequenceParameterSetNALUnit Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Adobe Flash Player's Flash10u.ocx component.  When processing a MP4 file (specifically the Sequence Parameter Set), Flash will see if pic_order_cnt_type is equal to 1, which sets the num_ref_frames_in_pic_order_cnt_cycle field, and then blindly copies data in offset_for_ref_frame on the stack, which allows arbitrary remote code execution under the context of the user.  Numerous reports also indicate that this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.",
