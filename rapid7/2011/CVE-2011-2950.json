    "Title": "RealNetworks Realplayer QCP Parsing Heap Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a heap overflow in Realplayer when handling a .QCP file. The specific flaw exists within qcpfformat.dll. A static 256 byte buffer is allocated on the heap and user-supplied data from the file is copied within a memory copy loop. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code running in the context of the web browser via a .QCP file with a specially crafted \"fmt\" chunk. At this moment this module exploits the flaw on Windows XP IE6, IE7.",
