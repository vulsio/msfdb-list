    "Title": "rsyslog Long Tag Off-By-Two DoS",
    "Description": "This module triggers an off-by-two overflow in the rsyslog daemon. This flaw is unlikely to yield code execution but is effective at shutting down a remote log daemon. This bug was introduced in version 4.6.0 and corrected in 4.6.8/5.8.5. Compiler differences may prevent this bug from causing any noticeable result on many systems (RHEL6 is affected).",
