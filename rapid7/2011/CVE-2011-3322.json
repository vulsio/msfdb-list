    "Title": "Procyon Core Server HMI Coreservice.exe Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the coreservice.exe component of Proycon Core Server <= v1.13. While processing a password, the application fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack. This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution.  Also, after the payload exits, Coreservice.exe should automatically recover.",
