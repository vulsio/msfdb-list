    "Title": "MPlayer SAMI Subtitle File Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow found in the handling of SAMI subtitles files in MPlayer SVN Versions before 33471. It currently targets SMPlayer 0.6.8, which is distributed with a vulnerable version of MPlayer. The overflow is triggered when an unsuspecting victim opens a movie file first, followed by loading the malicious SAMI subtitles file from the GUI. Or, it can also be done from the console with the MPlayer \"-sub\" option.",
