    "Title": "Firefox 8/9 AttributeChildRemoved() Use-After-Free",
    "Description": "This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox 8/8.0.1 and 9/9.0.1. Removal of child nodes from the nsDOMAttribute can allow for a child to still be accessible after removal due to a premature notification of AttributeChildRemoved. Since mFirstChild is not set to NULL until after this call is made, this means the removed child will be accessible after it has been removed. By carefully manipulating the memory layout, this can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
