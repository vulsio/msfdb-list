    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the lib/functions.php for phpLDAPadmin versions 1.2.1.1 and earlier that allows attackers input parsed directly to the create_function() php function. A patch was issued that uses a whitelist regex expression to check the user supplied input before being parsed to the create_function() call.",
