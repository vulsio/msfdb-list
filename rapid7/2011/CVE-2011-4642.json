The vulnerability exists in the 'mappy' search command which allows attackers to run Python code. To exploit this vulnerability, a valid Splunk user with the admin role is required. By default, this module uses the credential of \"admin:changeme\", the default Administrator credential for Splunk. Note that the Splunk web interface runs as SYSTEM on Windows and as root on Linux by default.",
