    "Title": "V-CMS PHP File Upload and Execute",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found on V-CMS's inline image upload feature. The problem is due to the inline_image_upload.php file not checking the file type before saving it on the web server. This allows any malicious user to upload a script (such as PHP) without authentication, and then execute it with a GET request.  The issue is fixed in 1.1 by checking the extension name.  By default, 1.1 only allows jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, but it is still possible to upload a PHP file as one of those extension names, which may still be leveraged in an attack.",
