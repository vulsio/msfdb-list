    "Title": "Hashtable Collisions",
    "Description": "This module uses a denial-of-service (DoS) condition appearing in a variety of programming languages. This vulnerability occurs when storing multiple values in a hash table and all values have the same hash value. This can cause a web server parsing the POST parameters issued with a request into a hash table to consume hours of CPU with a single HTTP request.  Currently, only the hash functions for PHP and Java are implemented. This module was tested with PHP + httpd, Tomcat, Glassfish and Geronimo. It also generates a random payload to bypass some IDS signatures.",
