    "Title": "Blue Coat Authentication and Authorization Agent (BCAAA) 5 Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in process bcaaa-130.exe (port 16102), which comes as part of the Blue Coat Authentication proxy.  Please note that by default, this exploit will attempt up to three times in order to successfully gain remote code execution (in some cases, it takes as many as five times).  This can cause your activity to look even more suspicious.  To modify the number of exploit attempts, set the ATTEMPTS option.",
