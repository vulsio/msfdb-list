    "Title": "MS12-027 MSCOMCTL ActiveX Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in MSCOMCTL.OCX. It uses a malicious RTF to embed the specially crafted MSComctlLib.ListViewCtrl.2 Control as exploited in the wild on April 2012.  This module targets Office 2007 and Office 2010 targets. The DEP/ASLR bypass on Office 2010 is done with the Ikazuchi ROP chain proposed by Abysssec. This chain uses \"msgr3en.dll\", which will load after office got load, so the malicious file must be loaded through \"File / Open\" to achieve exploitation.",
