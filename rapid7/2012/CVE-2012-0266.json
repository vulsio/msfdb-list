    "Title": "NTR ActiveX Control Check() Method Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in NTR ActiveX 1.1.8. The vulnerability exists in the Check() method, due to the insecure usage of strcat to build a URL using the bstrParams parameter contents (note: this is also the reason why the module won't allow you to modify the URIPATH), which leads to code execution under the context of the user visiting a malicious web page. In order to bypass DEP and ASLR on Windows Vista and Windows 7 JRE 6 is needed.",
