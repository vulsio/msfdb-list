    "Title": "Oracle AutoVue ActiveX Control SetMarkupMode Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in the AutoVue.ocx ActiveX control. The vulnerability, due to the insecure usage of an strcpy like function in the SetMarkupMode method, when handling a specially crafted sMarkup argument, allows to trigger a stack based buffer overflow which leads to code execution under the context of the user visiting a malicious web page. The module has been successfully tested against Oracle AutoVue Desktop Version 20.0.0 (AutoVue.ocx 20.0.0.7330) on IE 6, 7, 8 and 9 (Java 6 needed to DEP and ASLR bypass).",
