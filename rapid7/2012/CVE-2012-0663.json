    "Title": "Apple QuickTime TeXML Style Element Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Apple QuickTime. When handling a TeXML file, it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, and then gain arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.  This is due to the QuickTime3GPP.gtx component not handling certain Style subfields properly, storing user-supplied data on the stack, which results the overflow.",
