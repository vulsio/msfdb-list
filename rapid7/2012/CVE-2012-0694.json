    "Title": "SugarCRM unserialize() PHP Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a php unserialize() vulnerability in SugarCRM <= 6.3.1 which could be abused to allow authenticated SugarCRM users to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the webserver.  The dangerous unserialize() exists in the 'include/MVC/View/views/view.list.php' script, which is called with user controlled data from the 'current_query_by_page' parameter. The exploit abuses the __destruct() method from the SugarTheme class to write arbitrary PHP code to a 'pathCache.php' on the web root.",
