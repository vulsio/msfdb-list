    "Description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in version <= 4.3.2.0 of Irfanview's JPEG2000.dll plugin. This exploit has been tested on a specific version of irfanview (v4.3.2), although other versions may work also. The vulnerability is triggered via parsing an invalid qcd chunk structure and specifying a malformed qcd size and data. Payload delivery and vulnerability trigger can be executed in multiple ways. The user can double click the file, use the file dialog, open via the icon and drag/drop the file into Irfanview's window. An egg hunter is used for stability.",
