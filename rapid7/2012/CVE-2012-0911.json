    "Title": "Tiki Wiki unserialize() PHP Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a php unserialize() vulnerability in Tiki Wiki <= 8.3 which could be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the webserver user. The dangerous unserialize() exists in the 'tiki-print_multi_pages.php' script, which is called with user controlled data from the 'printpages' parameter. The exploit abuses the __destruct() method from the Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy class to write arbitrary PHP code to a file on the Tiki Wiki web directory. In order to run successfully three conditions must be satisfied (1) display_errors php setting must be On to disclose the filesystem path of Tiki Wiki, (2) The Tiki Wiki Multiprint feature must be enabled to exploit the unserialize() and (3) a php version older than 5.3.4 must be used to allow poison null bytes in filesystem related functions. The exploit has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 9.10 and Tiki Wiki 8.3.",
