    "Description": "This module abuses multiple issues in FreeFloat: 1. No credential is actually needed to login; 2. User's default path is in C:\\, and this cannot be changed; 3. User can write to anywhere on the server's file system.  As a result of these poor implementations, a malicious user can just log in and then upload files, and let WMI (Management Instrumentation service) to execute the payload uploaded.",
