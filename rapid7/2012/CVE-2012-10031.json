    "Title": "BlazeVideo HDTV Player Pro v6.6 Filename Handling Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in BlazeVideo HDTV Player's filename handling routine.  When supplying a string of input data embedded in a .plf file, the MediaPlayerCtrl.dll component will try to extract a filename by using PathFindFileNameA(), and then copies whatever the return value is on the stack by using an inline strcpy.  As a result, if this input data is long enough, it can cause a stack-based buffer overflow, which may lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
