    "Title": "Narcissus Image Configuration Passthru Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Narcissus image configuration function.  This is due to the backend.php file not handling the $release parameter properly, and then passes it on to the configure_image() function.  In this function, the $release parameter can be used to inject system commands for passthru (a PHP function that's meant to be used to run a bash script by the vulnerable application), which allows remote code execution under the context of the web server.",
