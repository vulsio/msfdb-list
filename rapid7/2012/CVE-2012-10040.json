    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Openfiler v2.x which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the 'openfiler' user. The 'system.html' file uses user controlled data from the 'device' parameter to create a new 'NetworkCard' object. The class constructor in 'network.inc' calls exec() with the supplied data. The 'openfiler' user may 'sudo /bin/bash' without providing a system password.",
