    "Description": "This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in WAN Emulator version 2.3 which can be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands under the context of the 'www-data' user. The 'result.php' script calls shell_exec() with user controlled data from the 'pc' parameter. This module also exploits a command execution vulnerability to gain root privileges. The 'dosu' binary is suid 'root' and vulnerable to command execution in argument one.",
