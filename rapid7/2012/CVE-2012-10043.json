    "Title": "ActiveFax (ActFax) 4.3 Client Importer Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in ActiveFax Server. The vulnerability is a stack based buffer overflow in the \"Import Users from File\" function, due to the insecure usage of strcpy while parsing the csv formatted file. The module creates a .exp file that must be imported with ActiveFax Server. It must be imported with the default character set 'ECMA-94 / Latin 1 (ISO 8859)'. The module has been tested successfully on ActFax Server 4.32 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1. In the Windows XP case, when ActFax runs as a service, it will execute as SYSTEM.",
