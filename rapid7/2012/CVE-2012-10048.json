    "Description": "This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Zenoss 3.x which could be abused to allow authenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the 'zenoss' user. The show_daemon_xml_configs() function in the 'ZenossInfo.py' script calls Popen() with user controlled data from the 'daemon' parameter.",
