    "Title": "Umbraco CMS Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378. The payload is uploaded as an ASPX script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to codeEditorSave.asmx, which permits unauthorized file upload via the SaveDLRScript operation. SaveDLRScript is also subject to a path traversal vulnerability, allowing code to be placed into the web-accessible /umbraco/ directory. The module writes, executes and then overwrites an ASPX script; note that though the script content is removed, the file remains on the target. Automatic cleanup of the file is intended if a meterpreter payload is used. This module has been tested successfully on Umbraco CMS 4.7.0.378 on a Windows 7 32-bit SP1. In this scenario, the \"IIS APPPOOL\\ASP.NET v4.0\" user must have write permissions on the Windows Temp folder.",
