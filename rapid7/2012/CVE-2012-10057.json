    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in ispVM System 18.0.2.  Due to the way ispVM handles .xcf files, it is possible to cause a buffer overflow with a specially crafted file, when a long value is supplied for the version attribute of the ispXCF tag. It results in arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
