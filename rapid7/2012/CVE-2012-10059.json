    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Dolibarr ERP/CRM 3's backup feature.  This software is used to manage a company's business information such as contacts, invoices, orders, stocks, agenda, etc. When processing a database backup request, the export.php function does not check the input given to the sql_compat parameter, which allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject system commands into it, and then gain arbitrary code execution.",
