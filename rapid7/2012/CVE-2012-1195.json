    "Description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on LANDesk Lenovo ThinkManagement Suite 9.0.2 and 9.0.3.  The payload is uploaded as an ASP script by sending a specially crafted SOAP request to \"/landesk/managementsuite/core/core.anonymous/ServerSetup.asmx\" , via a \"RunAMTCommand\" operation with the command '-PutUpdateFileCore' as the argument.  After execution, the ASP script with the payload is deleted by sending another specially crafted SOAP request to \"WSVulnerabilityCore/VulCore.asmx\" via a \"SetTaskLogByFile\" operation.",
