    "Title": "VLC MMS Stream Handling Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow in VLC media player VLC media player prior to 2.0.0. The vulnerability is due to a dangerous use of sprintf which can result in a stack buffer overflow when handling a malicious MMS URI. This module uses the browser as attack vector. A specially crafted MMS URI is used to trigger the overflow and get flow control through SEH overwrite. Control is transferred to code located in the heap through a standard heap spray. The module only targets IE6 and IE7 because no DEP/ASLR bypass has been provided.",
