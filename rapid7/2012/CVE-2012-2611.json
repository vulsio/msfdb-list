    "Title": "SAP NetWeaver Dispatcher DiagTraceR3Info Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the SAP NetWeaver Dispatcher service. The overflow occurs in the DiagTraceR3Info() function and allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by supplying a special crafted Diag packet. The Dispatcher service is only vulnerable if the Developer Traces have been configured at levels 2 or 3. The module has been successfully tested on SAP Netweaver 7.0 EHP2 SP6 over Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2003 SP2 (DEP bypass).",
