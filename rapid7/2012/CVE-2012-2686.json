    "Title": "OpenSSL TLS 1.1 and 1.2 AES-NI DoS",
    "Description": "The AES-NI implementation of OpenSSL 1.0.1c does not properly compute the length of an encrypted message when used with a TLS version 1.1 or above. This leads to an integer underflow which can cause a DoS. The vulnerable function aesni_cbc_hmac_sha1_cipher is only included in the 64-bit versions of OpenSSL. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 12.04 (64-bit) with the default OpenSSL 1.0.1c package.",
