    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability found in Symantec Web Gateway's HTTP service.  While handling the filename parameter, the Spywall API does not do any filtering before passing it to an exec() call in proxy_file(), thus results in remote code execution under the context of the web server. Please note authentication is NOT needed to gain access.",
