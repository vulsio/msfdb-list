    "Title": "Oracle Forms and Reports Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module uses two vulnerabilities in Oracle Forms and Reports to get remote code execution on the host. The showenv url can be used to disclose information about a server. A second vulnerability that allows arbitrary reading and writing to the host filesystem can then be used to write a shell from a remote url to a known local path disclosed from the previous vulnerability. The local path being accessible from an URL allows an attacker to perform the remote code execution using, for example, a .jsp shell. This module was tested successfully on Windows and Oracle Forms and Reports 10.1.",
