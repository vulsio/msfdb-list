    "Title": "Plixer Scrutinizer NetFlow and sFlow Analyzer 9 Default MySQL Credential",
    "Description": "This exploits an insecure config found in Scrutinizer NetFlow & sFlow Analyzer. By default, the software installs a default password in MySQL, and binds the service to \"0.0.0.0\".  This allows any remote user to login to MySQL, and then gain arbitrary remote code execution under the context of 'SYSTEM'.  Examples of default credentials include: 'scrutinizer:admin', and 'scrutremote:admin'.",
