    "Title": "Firefox 5.0 - 15.0.1 __exposedProps__ XCS Code Execution",
    "Description": "On versions of Firefox from 5.0 to 15.0.1, the InstallTrigger global, when given invalid input, would throw an exception that did not have an __exposedProps__ property set. By re-setting this property on the exception object's prototype, the chrome-based defineProperty method is made available.  With the defineProperty method, functions belonging to window and document can be overridden with a function that gets called from chrome-privileged context. From here, another vulnerability in the crypto.generateCRMFRequest function is used to \"peek\" into the context's private scope. Since the window does not have a chrome:// URL, the insecure parts of Components.classes are not available, so instead the AddonManager API is invoked to silently install a malicious plugin.",
