    "Description": "This module exploits a heap overflow in NFRAgent.exe, a component of Novell File Reporter (NFR). The vulnerability occurs when handling requests of name \"SRS\", where NFRAgent.exe fails to generate a response in a secure way, copying user controlled data into a fixed-length buffer in the heap without bounds checking. This module has been tested against NFR Agent 1.0.4.3 (File Reporter 1.0.2).",
