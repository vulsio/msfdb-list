    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Ricoh DC's DL-10 SR10 FTP service.  By supplying a long string of data to the USER command, it is possible to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, which allows remote code execution under the context of the user. Please note that in order to trigger the vulnerability, the server must be configured with a log file name (by default, it's disabled).",
