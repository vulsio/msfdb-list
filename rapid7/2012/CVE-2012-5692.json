    "Description": "This module exploits a php unserialize() vulnerability in Invision IP.Board <= 3.3.4 which could be abused to allow unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code under the context of the webserver user.  The dangerous unserialize() exists in the '/admin/sources/base/core.php' script, which is called with user controlled data from the cookie. The exploit abuses the __destruct() method from the dbMain class to write arbitrary PHP code to a file on the Invision IP.Board web directory.  The exploit has been tested successfully on Invision IP.Board 3.3.4.",
