    "Title": "Quest InTrust Annotation Objects Uninitialized Pointer",
    "Description": "This module exploits an uninitialized variable vulnerability in the Annotation Objects ActiveX component. The ActiveX component loads into memory without opting into ALSR so this module exploits the vulnerability against windows Vista and Windows 7 targets. A large heap spray is required to fulfill the requirement that EAX points to part of the ROP chain in a heap chunk and the calculated call will hit the pivot in a separate heap chunk. This will take some time in the users browser.",
