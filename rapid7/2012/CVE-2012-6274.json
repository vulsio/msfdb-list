    "Title": "BigAnt Server DUPF Command Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Description": "This exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in BigAnt Server 2.97 SP7. A lack of authentication allows to make unauthenticated file uploads through a DUPF command. Additionally the filename option in the same command can be used to launch a directory traversal attack and achieve arbitrary file upload. The module uses the Windows Management Instrumentation service to execute an arbitrary payload on vulnerable installations of BigAnt on Windows XP and 2003. It has been successfully tested on BigAnt Server 2.97 SP7 over Windows XP SP3 and 2003 SP2.",
