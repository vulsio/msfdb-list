    "Title": "Movable Type 4.2x, 4.3x Web Upgrade Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module can be used to execute a payload on MoveableType (MT) that exposes a CGI script, mt-upgrade.cgi (usually at /mt/mt-upgrade.cgi), that is used during installation and updating of the platform. The vulnerability arises due to the following properties: 1. This script may be invoked remotely without requiring authentication to any MT instance. 2. Through a crafted POST request, it is possible to invoke particular database migration functions (i.e. functions that bring the existing database up-to-date with an updated codebase) by name and with particular parameters. 3. A particular migration function, core_drop_meta_for_table, allows a class parameter to be set which is used directly in a perl eval statement, allowing perl code injection.",
