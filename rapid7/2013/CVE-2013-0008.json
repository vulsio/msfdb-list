    "Title": "MS13-005 HWND_BROADCAST Low to Medium Integrity Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "Due to a problem with isolating window broadcast messages in the Windows kernel, an attacker can broadcast commands from a lower Integrity Level process to a higher Integrity Level process, thereby effecting a privilege escalation. This issue affects Windows Vista, 7, 8, Server 2008, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and RT. Note that spawning a command prompt with the shortcut key combination Win+Shift+# does not work in Vista, so the attacker will have to check if the user is already running a command prompt and set SPAWN_PROMPT false. Three exploit techniques are available with this module. The WEB technique will execute a powershell encoded payload from a Web location.  The FILE technique will drop an executable to the file system, set it to medium integrity and execute it. The TYPE technique will attempt to execute a powershell encoded payload directly from the command line, but may take some time to complete.",
