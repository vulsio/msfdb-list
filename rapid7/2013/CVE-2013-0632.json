    "Title": "Adobe ColdFusion RDS Authentication Bypass",
    "Description": "Adobe ColdFusion 9.0, 9.0.1, 9.0.2, and 10 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication using the RDS component. Due to default settings or misconfiguration, its password can be set to an empty value. This allows an attacker to create a session via the RDS login that can be carried over to the admin web interface even though the passwords might be different, and therefore bypassing authentication on the admin web interface leading to arbitrary code execution. Tested on Windows and Linux with ColdFusion 9.",
