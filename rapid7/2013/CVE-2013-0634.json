    "Title": "Adobe Flash Player Regular Expression Heap Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in the ActiveX component of Adobe Flash Player before 11.5.502.149. By supplying a specially crafted swf file with special regex value, it is possible to trigger a memory corruption, which results in remote code execution under the context of the user, as exploited in the wild in February 2013. This module has been tested successfully with Adobe Flash Player 11.5 before 11.5.502.149 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1 before MS13-063, since it takes advantage of a predictable SharedUserData in order to leak ntdll and bypass ASLR.",
