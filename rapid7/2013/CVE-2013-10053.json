    "Title": "ZPanel 10.0.0.2 htpasswd Module Username Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in ZPanel's htpasswd module. When creating .htaccess using the htpasswd module, the username field can be used to inject system commands, which is passed on to a system() function for executing the system's htpasswd command. Please note: In order to use this module, you must have a valid account to login to ZPanel.  An account part of any of the default groups should suffice, such as: Administrators, Resellers, or Users (Clients).  By default, there's already a 'zadmin' user, but the password is randomly generated.",
