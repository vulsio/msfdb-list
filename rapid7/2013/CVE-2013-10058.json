    "Title": "Linksys WRT160nv2 apply.cgi Remote Command Injection",
    "Description": "Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module has been tested on a Linksys WRT160n version 2 - firmware version v2.0.03. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the tftp client from the device to stage to native payloads from the command injection.",
