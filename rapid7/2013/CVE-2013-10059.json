    "Title": "D-Link DIR615h OS Command Injection",
    "Description": "Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface, where default credentials are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. This module was tested against a DIR-615 hardware revision H1 - firmware version 8.04. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. The exploit uses the wget client from the device to convert the command injection into an arbitrary payload execution.",
