    "Title": "Netgear DGN2200B pppoe.cgi Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "Some Netgear Routers are vulnerable to an authenticated OS command injection on their web interface. Default credentials for the web interface are admin/admin or admin/password. Since it is a blind os command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module overwrites parts of the PPOE configuration, while the module tries to restore it after exploitation configuration backup is recommended.",
