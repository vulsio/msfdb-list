    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in ActFax Server 5.01 RAW server. The RAW Server can be used to transfer fax messages without any underlying protocols. To note significant fields in the fax being transferred, like the fax number or the recipient, ActFax data fields can be used. This module exploits a buffer overflow in the handling of the @F506 fields due to the insecure usage of strcpy. This module has been tested successfully on ActFax 5.01 over Windows XP SP3 (English).",
