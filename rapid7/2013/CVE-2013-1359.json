An authentication bypass in the Web Administration interface allows to abuse the \"appliance\" application and upload an arbitrary payload embedded in a JSP. The module has been tested successfully on SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6017 over Windows 2003 SP2 and SonicWALL GMS 6.0.6022 Virtual Appliance (Linux). On the Virtual Appliance the linux meterpreter hasn't run successfully while testing, shell payload has been used.",
