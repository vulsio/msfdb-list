    "Title": "Nginx HTTP Server 1.3.9-1.4.0 Chunked Encoding Stack Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in versions 1.3.9 to 1.4.0 of nginx. The exploit first triggers an integer overflow in the ngx_http_parse_chunked() by supplying an overly long hex value as chunked block size. This value is later used when determining the number of bytes to read into a stack buffer, thus the overflow becomes possible.",
