    "Description": "This module exploits an information disclosure vulnerability in ZPanel. The vulnerability is due to a vulnerable version of pChart used by ZPanel that allows unauthenticated users to read arbitrary files remotely on the file system. This particular module utilizes this vulnerability to identify the username/password combination of the MySQL instance. With the credentials the attackers can login to PHPMyAdmin and execute SQL commands to drop a malicious payload on the filesystem and call it leading to remote code execution.",
