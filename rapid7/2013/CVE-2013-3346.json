    "Description": "This module exploits an use after free condition on Adobe Reader versions 11.0.2, 10.1.6 and 9.5.4 and prior. The vulnerability exists while handling the ToolButton object, where the cEnable callback can be used to early free the object memory. Later use of the object allows triggering the use after free condition. This module has been tested successfully on Adobe Reader 11.0.2 and 10.0.4, with IE and Windows XP SP3, as exploited in the wild in November, 2013. At the moment, this module doesn't support Adobe Reader 9 targets; in order to exploit Adobe Reader 9 the fileformat version of the exploit can be used.",
