The vulnerability exists on the close_window.cgi CGI application, and is due to the insecure usage of strcpy. In order to get a session, the module will execute system() from libc with an arbitrary CMD payload sent on the User-Agent header. This module has been tested successfully on Supermicro Onboard IPMI (X9SCL/X9SCM) with firmware SMT_X9_214.",
