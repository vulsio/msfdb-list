    "Title": "Gitlab-shell Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module takes advantage of the addition of authorized ssh keys in the gitlab-shell functionality of Gitlab. Versions of gitlab-shell prior to 1.7.4 used the ssh key provided directly in a system call resulting in a command injection vulnerability. As this relies on adding an ssh key to an account, valid credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.",
