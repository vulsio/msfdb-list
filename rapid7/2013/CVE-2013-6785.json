    "Title": "Supermicro Onboard IPMI url_redirect.cgi Authenticated Directory Traversal",
    "Description": "This module abuses a directory traversal vulnerability in the url_redirect.cgi application accessible through the web interface of Supermicro Onboard IPMI controllers.  The vulnerability is present due to a lack of sanitization of the url_name parameter. This allows an attacker with a valid, but not necessarily administrator-level account, to access the contents of any file on the system. This includes the /nv/PSBlock file, which contains the cleartext credentials for all configured accounts. This module has been tested on a Supermicro Onboard IPMI (X9SCL/X9SCM) with firmware version SMT_X9_214. Other file names to try include /PSStore, /PMConfig.dat, and /wsman/simple_auth.passwd",
