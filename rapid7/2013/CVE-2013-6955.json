    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM) versions 4.x, which allows the execution of arbitrary commands under root privileges. The vulnerability is located in /webman/imageSelector.cgi, which allows to append arbitrary data to a given file using a so called SLICEUPLOAD functionality, which can be triggered by an unauthenticated user with a specially crafted HTTP request. This is exploited by this module to append the given commands to /redirect.cgi, which is a regular shell script file, and can be invoked with another HTTP request. Synology reported that the vulnerability has been fixed with versions 4.0-2259, 4.2-3243, and 4.3-3810 Update 1, respectively; the 4.1 branch remains vulnerable.",
