    "Description": "This module triggers an infinite loop in Apache Commons FileUpload 1.0 through 1.3 via a specially crafted Content-Type header. Apache Tomcat 7 and Apache Tomcat 8 use a copy of FileUpload to handle mime-multipart requests, therefore, Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.50 and 8.0.0-RC1 through 8.0.1 are affected by this issue. Tomcat 6 also uses Commons FileUpload as part of the Manager application.",
