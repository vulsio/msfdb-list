    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the 3D Acceleration support for VirtualBox. The vulnerability exists in the remote rendering of OpenGL-based 3D graphics. By sending a sequence of specially crafted rendering messages, a virtual machine can exploit an out of bounds array access to corrupt memory and escape to the host. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (64 bits) as Host running Virtual Box 4.3.6.",
