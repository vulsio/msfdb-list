    "Description": "This module exploits a remote arbitrary file write vulnerability in SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2014 SP2 and prior.  For targets running Windows Vista or newer the payload is written to the startup folder for all users and executed upon next user logon.  For targets before Windows Vista code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload as an exe file, and then upload another mof file, which schedules WMI to execute the uploaded payload.  This module has been tested successfully on SolidWorks Workgroup PDM 2011 SP0 on Windows XP SP3 (EN) and Windows 7 SP1 (EN).",
