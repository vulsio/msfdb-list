    "Title": "Array Networks vAPV and vxAG Private Key Privilege Escalation Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a default hardcoded private SSH key or default hardcoded login and password in the vAPV 8.3.2.17 and vxAG 9.2.0.34 appliances made by Array Networks. After logged in as the unprivileged user, it's possible to modify the world-writable file /ca/bin/monitor.sh with attacker-supplied arbitrary code. Execution is possible by using the backend tool, running setuid, to turn the debug monitoring on. This makes it possible to trigger a payload with root privileges.",
