    "Title": "Kloxo SQL Injection and Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability affecting Kloxo, as exploited in the wild on January 2014. The SQL injection issue can be abused in order to retrieve the Kloxo admin cleartext password from the database. With admin access to the web control panel, remote PHP code execution can be achieved by abusing the Command Center function. The module tries to find the first server in the tree view, unless the server information is provided, in which case it executes the payload there.",
