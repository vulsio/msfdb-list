    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability found in Pandora FMS 5.0RC1 and lower. It will leverage an unauthenticated command injection in the Anyterm service on port 8023/TCP. Commands are executed as the user \"pandora\". In Pandora FMS 4.1 and 5.0RC1 the user \"artica\" is not assigned a password by default, which makes it possible to su to this user from the \"pandora\" user. The \"artica\" user has access to sudo without a password, which makes it possible to escalate privileges to root. However, Pandora FMS 4.0 and lower force a password for the \"artica\" user during installation.",
