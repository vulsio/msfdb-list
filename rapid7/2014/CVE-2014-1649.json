    "Description": "This module exploits a code execution flaw in Symantec Workspace Streaming. The vulnerability exists in the ManagementAgentServer.putFile XMLRPC call exposed by the as_agent.exe service, which allows for uploading arbitrary files under the server root. This module abuses the auto deploy feature in the JBoss as_ste.exe instance in order to achieve remote code execution. This module has been tested successfully on Symantec Workspace Streaming 6.1 SP8 and Windows 2003 SP2, and reported to affect 7.5.0.x. Abused services listen on a single-machine deployment and also in the backend role in a multiple-machine deployment.",
