    "Title": "ifwatchd Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges on QNX 6.4.x and 6.5.x systems by exploiting the ifwatchd suid executable.  ifwatchd allows users to specify scripts to execute using the '-A' command line argument; however, it does not drop privileges when executing user-supplied scripts, resulting in execution of arbitrary commands as root.  This module has been tested successfully on QNX Neutrino 6.5.0 (x86) and 6.5.0 SP1 (x86).",
