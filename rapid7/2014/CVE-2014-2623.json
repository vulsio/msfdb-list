    "Description": "This module exploits a remote command execution on HP Data Protector 8.10. Arbitrary commands can be executed by sending crafted requests with opcode 28 to the OmniInet service listening on the TCP/5555 port. Since there is a strict length limitation on the command, rundll32.exe is executed, and the payload is provided through a DLL by a fake SMB server. This module has been tested successfully on HP Data Protector 8.1 on Windows 7 SP1.",
