    "Title": "HP Network Node Manager I PMD Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in HP Network Node Manager I (NNMi). The vulnerability exists in the pmd service, due to the insecure usage of functions like strcpy and strcat while handling stack_option packets with user controlled data. In order to bypass ASLR this module uses a proto_tbl packet to leak an libov pointer from the stack and finally build the ROP chain to avoid NX.",
