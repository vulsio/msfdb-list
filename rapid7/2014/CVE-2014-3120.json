    "Description": "This module exploits a remote command execution (RCE) vulnerability in ElasticSearch, exploitable by default on ElasticSearch prior to 1.2.0. The bug is found in the REST API, which does not require authentication, where the search function allows dynamic scripts execution. It can be used for remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code. This module has been tested successfully on ElasticSearch 1.1.1 on Ubuntu Server 12.04 and Windows XP SP3.",
