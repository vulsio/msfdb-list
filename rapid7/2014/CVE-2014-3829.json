    "Title": "Centreon SQL and Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits several vulnerabilities on Centreon 2.5.1 and prior and Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2 and prior. Due to a combination of SQL injection and command injection in the displayServiceStatus.php component, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands as long as there is a valid session registered in the centreon.session table. In order to have a valid session, all it takes is a successful login from anybody. The exploit itself does not require any authentication.  This module has been tested successfully on Centreon Enterprise Server 2.2.",
