    "Description": "A heap overflow in IOHIKeyboardMapper::parseKeyMapping allows kernel memory corruption in Mac OS X before 10.10. By abusing a bug in the IORegistry, kernel pointers can also be leaked, allowing a full kASLR bypass.  Tested on Mavericks 10.9.5, and should work on previous versions.  The issue was patched silently in Yosemite.",
