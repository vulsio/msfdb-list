    "Description": "A website that serves a JSONP endpoint that accepts a custom alphanumeric callback of 1200 chars can be abused to serve an encoded swf payload that steals the contents of a same-domain URL. Flash < 14.0.0.145 is required. This module spins up a web server that, upon navigation from a user, attempts to abuse the specified JSONP endpoint URLs by stealing the response from GET requests to STEAL_URLS.",
