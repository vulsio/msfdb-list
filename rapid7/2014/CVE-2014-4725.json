    "Title": "Wordpress MailPoet Newsletters (wysija-newsletters) Unauthenticated File Upload",
    "Description": "The Wordpress plugin \"MailPoet Newsletters\" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",
