    "Description": "This module combines two vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution on affected Android devices. First, the module exploits CVE-2014-6041, a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability present in versions of Android's open source stock browser (the AOSP Browser) prior to 4.4. Second, the Google Play store's web interface fails to enforce a X-Frame-Options: DENY header (XFO) on some error pages, and therefore, can be targeted for script injection. As a result, this leads to remote code execution through Google Play's remote installation feature, as any application available on the Google Play store can be installed and launched on the user's device. This module requires that the user is logged into Google with a vulnerable browser. To list the activities in an APK, you can use `aapt dump badging /path/to/app.apk`.",

    "Description": "This module exploits a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability present in all versions of Android's open source stock browser before 4.4, and Android apps running on < 4.4 that embed the WebView component. If successful, an attacker can leverage this bug to scrape both cookie data and page contents from a vulnerable browser window. If your target URLs use X-Frame-Options, you can enable the \"BYPASS_XFO\" option, which will cause a popup window to be used. This requires a click from the user and is much less stealthy, but is generally harmless-looking. By supplying a CUSTOM_JS parameter and ensuring CLOSE_POPUP is set to false, this module also allows running aribtrary javascript in the context of the targeted URL. Some sample UXSS scripts are provided in data/exploits/uxss.",
