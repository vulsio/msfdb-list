    "Title": "MS14-068 Microsoft Kerberos Checksum Validation Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the Microsoft Kerberos implementation. The problem exists in the verification of the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) from a Kerberos TGS request, where a domain user may forge a PAC with arbitrary privileges, including Domain Administrator. This module requests a TGT ticket with a forged PAC and exports it to a MIT Kerberos Credential Cache file. It can be loaded on Windows systems with the Mimikatz help. It has been tested successfully on Windows 2008.",
