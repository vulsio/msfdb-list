    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in SonicWall Global Management System Virtual Appliance versions 8.1 (Build 8110.1197) and below. This virtual appliance can be downloaded from http://www.sonicwall.com/products/sonicwall-gms/ and is used 'in a holistic way to manage your entire network security environment.' These vulnerable versions (8.1 Build 8110.1197 and below) do not prevent unauthenticated, external entities from making XML-RPC requests to port 21009 of the virtual app. After the XML-RPC call is made, a shell script is called like so: 'timeSetup.sh --tz=\"`command injection here`\"' --usentp=\"blah\"'.",
