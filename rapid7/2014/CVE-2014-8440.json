The vulnerability occurs in the ByteArray::UncompressViaZlibVariant method, which fails to initialize allocated memory. When using a correct memory layout this vulnerability leads to a ByteArray object corruption, which can be abused to access and corrupt memory. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE 8 and IE11 with Flash 15.0.0.189.",
