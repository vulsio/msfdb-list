    "Title": "tnftp \"savefile\" Arbitrary Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in tnftp's handling of the resolved output filename - called \"savefile\" in the source - from a requested resource.  If tnftp is executed without the -o command-line option, it will resolve the output filename from the last component of the requested resource.  If the output filename begins with a \"|\" character, tnftp will pass the fetched resource's output to the command directly following the \"|\" character through the use of the popen() function.",
