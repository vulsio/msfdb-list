    "Title": "WordPress WP EasyCart Unrestricted File Upload",
    "Description": "WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the /inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php script does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges of the web server.  In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by using the WordPress credentials of a user with any role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin password will be required that is in use by any admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will setup a user called \"demouser\" with a preset password of \"demouser\".",
