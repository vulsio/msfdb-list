    "Title": "WordPress Photo Gallery Unrestricted File Upload",
    "Description": "Photo Gallery Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the photo-gallery\\photo-gallery.php script allows access to filemanager\\UploadHandler.php. The post() method in UploadHandler.php does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files.  This module was tested on version 1.2.5.",
