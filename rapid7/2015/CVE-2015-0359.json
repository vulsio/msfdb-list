    "Title": "Adobe Flash Player domainMemory ByteArray Use After Free",
    "Description": "This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability occurs when the ByteArray assigned to the current ApplicationDomain is freed from an ActionScript worker, when forcing a reallocation by copying more contents than the original capacity, but Flash forgets to update the domainMemory pointer, leading to a use-after-free situation when the main worker references the domainMemory again. This module has been tested successfully on Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE 8 and IE11 with Flash 17.0.0.134.",
