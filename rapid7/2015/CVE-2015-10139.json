    "Title": "WordPress WPLMS Theme Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "The WordPress WPLMS theme from version 1.5.2 to 1.8.4.1 allows an authenticated user of any user level to set any system option due to a lack of validation in the import_data function of /includes/func.php. The module first changes the admin e-mail address to prevent any notifications being sent to the actual administrator during the attack, re-enables user registration in case it has been disabled and sets the default role to be administrator.  This will allow for the user to create a new account with admin privileges via the default registration page found at /wp-login.php?action=register.",
