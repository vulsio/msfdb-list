    "Title": "SixApart MovableType Storable Perl Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a serialization flaw in MovableType before 5.2.12 to execute arbitrary code. The default nondestructive mode depends on the target server having the Object::MultiType and DateTime Perl modules installed in Perl's @INC paths. The destructive mode of operation uses only required MovableType dependencies, but it will noticeably corrupt the MovableType installation.",
