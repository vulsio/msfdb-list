    "Description": "This module dumps memory contents using a crafted Range header and affects only Windows 8.1, Server 2012, and Server 2012R2. Note that if the target is running in VMware Workstation, this module has a high likelihood of resulting in BSOD; however, VMware ESX and non-virtualized hosts seem stable. Using a larger target file should result in more memory being dumped, and SSL seems to produce more data as well.",
