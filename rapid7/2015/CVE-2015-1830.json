    "Description": "This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2015-1830) in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.11.2 for Windows. The module tries to upload a JSP payload to the /admin directory via the traversal path /fileserver/..\\\\admin\\\\ using an HTTP PUT request with the default ActiveMQ credentials admin:admin (or other credentials provided by the user). It then issues an HTTP GET request to /admin/<payload>.jsp on the target in order to trigger the payload and obtain a shell.",
