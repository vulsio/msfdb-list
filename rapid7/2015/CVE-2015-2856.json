    "Title": "Accellion FTA 'statecode' Cookie Arbitrary File Read",
    "Description": "This module exploits a file disclosure vulnerability in the Accellion File Transfer appliance. This vulnerability is triggered when a user-provided 'statecode' cookie parameter is appended to a file path that is processed as a HTML template. By prepending this cookie with directory traversal sequence and appending a NULL byte, any file readable by the web user can be exposed. The web user has read access to a number of sensitive files, including the system configuration and files uploaded to the appliance by users. This issue was confirmed on version FTA_9_11_200, but may apply to previous versions as well. This issue was fixed in software update FTA_9_11_210.",
