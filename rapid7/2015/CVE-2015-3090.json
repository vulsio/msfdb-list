    "Title": "Adobe Flash Player ShaderJob Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability related to the ShaderJob workings on Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability happens when trying to apply a Shader setting up the same Bitmap object as src and destination of the ShaderJob. Modifying the \"width\" attribute of the ShaderJob after starting the job it's possible to create a buffer overflow condition where the size of the destination buffer and the length of the copy are controlled. This module has been tested successfully on:  Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), IE11 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, Windows 7 SP1 (32-bit), Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, Windows 8.1, Firefox 38.0.5 and Adobe Flash 17.0.0.169, and Linux Mint \"Rebecca\" (32 bits), Firefox 33.0 and Adobe Flash 11.2.202.457.",
