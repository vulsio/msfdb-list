    "Description": "This module exploits the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands in ProFTPD version 1.3.5. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. The copy commands are executed with the rights of the ProFTPD service, which by default runs under the privileges of the 'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.",
