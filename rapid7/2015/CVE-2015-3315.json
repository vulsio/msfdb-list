    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges on Linux systems with a vulnerable version of Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT) configured as the crash handler. A race condition allows local users to change ownership of arbitrary files (CVE-2015-3315). This module uses a symlink attack on `/var/tmp/abrt/*/maps` to change the ownership of `/etc/passwd`, then adds a new user with UID=0 GID=0 to gain root privileges. Winning the race could take a few minutes. This module has been tested successfully on: abrt 2.1.11-12.el7 on RHEL 7.0 x86_64; abrt 2.1.5-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64; abrt 2.2.1-1.fc19 on Fedora Desktop 19 x86_64; abrt 2.2.2-2.fc20 on Fedora Desktop 20 x86_64; abrt 2.3.0-3.fc21 on Fedora Desktop 21 x86_64.",
