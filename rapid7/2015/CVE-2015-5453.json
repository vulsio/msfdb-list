    "Title": "Watchguard XCS Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits two separate vulnerabilities found in the Watchguard XCS virtual appliance to gain command execution. By exploiting an unauthenticated SQL injection, a remote attacker may insert a valid web user into the appliance database, and get access to the web interface. On the other hand, a vulnerability in the web interface allows the attacker to inject operating system commands as the 'nobody' user.",
