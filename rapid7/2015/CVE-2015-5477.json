    "Title": "BIND TKEY Query Denial of Service",
    "Description": "This module sends a malformed TKEY query, which exploits an error in handling TKEY queries on affected BIND9 'named' DNS servers. As a result, a vulnerable named server will exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure. This condition can be exploited in versions of BIND between BIND 9.1.0 through 9.8.x, 9.9.0 through 9.9.7-P1 and 9.10.0 through 9.10.2-P2.",
