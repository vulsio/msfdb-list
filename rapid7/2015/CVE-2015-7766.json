    "Description": "This module exploits a default credential vulnerability in ManageEngine OpManager, where a default hidden account \"IntegrationUser\" with administrator privileges exists. The account has a default password of \"plugin\" which cannot be reset through the user interface. By log-in and abusing the default administrator's SQL query functionality, it's possible to write a WAR payload to disk and trigger an automatic deployment of this payload. This module has been tested successfully on OpManager v11.0 and v11.4-v11.6 for Windows.",
