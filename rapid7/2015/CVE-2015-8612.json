    "Title": "blueman set_dhcp_handler D-Bus Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges by exploiting a Python code injection vulnerability in blueman versions prior to 2.0.3.  The `org.blueman.Mechanism.EnableNetwork` D-Bus interface exposes the `set_dhcp_handler` function which uses user input in a call to `eval`, without sanitization, resulting in arbitrary code execution as root.  This module has been tested successfully with blueman version 1.23 on Debian 8 Jessie (x64).",
