    "Title": "Apache Jetspeed Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Description": "This module exploits the unsecured User Manager REST API and a ZIP file path traversal in Apache Jetspeed-2, version 2.3.0 and unknown earlier versions, to upload and execute a shell.  Note: this exploit will create, use, and then delete a new admin user.  Warning: in testing, exploiting the file upload clobbered the web interface beyond repair. No workaround has been found yet. Use this module at your own risk. No check will be implemented.",
