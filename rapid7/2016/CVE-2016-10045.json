    "Title": "PHPMailer Sendmail Argument Injection",
    "Description": "PHPMailer versions up to and including 5.2.19 are affected by a vulnerability which can be leveraged by an attacker to write a file with partially controlled contents to an arbitrary location through injection of arguments that are passed to the sendmail binary. This module writes a payload to the web root of the webserver before then executing it with an HTTP request. The user running PHPMailer must have write access to the specified WEB_ROOT directory and successful exploitation can take a few minutes.",
