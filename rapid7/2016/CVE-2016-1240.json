    "Title": "Apache Tomcat on Ubuntu Log Init Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "Tomcat (6, 7, 8) packages provided by default repositories on Debian-based distributions (including Debian, Ubuntu etc.) provide a vulnerable tomcat init script that allows local attackers who have already gained access to the tomcat account (for example, by exploiting an RCE vulnerability in a java web application hosted on Tomcat, uploading a webshell etc.) to escalate their privileges from tomcat user to root and fully compromise the target system. Tested against Tomcat 8.0.32-1ubuntu1.1 on Ubuntu 16.04",
