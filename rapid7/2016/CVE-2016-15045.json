    "Title": "lastore-daemon D-Bus Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges on Deepin Linux systems by using lastore-daemon to install a package. The lastore-daemon D-Bus configuration on Deepin Linux permits any user in the sudo group to install arbitrary system packages without providing a password, resulting in code execution as root. By default, the first user created on the system is a member of the sudo group. This module has been tested successfully with lastore-daemon versions 0.9.53-1 on Deepin Linux 15.5 (x64); and 0.9.66-1 on Deepin Linux 15.7 (x64).",
