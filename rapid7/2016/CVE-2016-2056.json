    "Title": "Xymon useradm Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Xymon versions before 4.3.25 which allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user.  When adding a new user to the system via the web interface with `useradm.sh`, the user's username and password are passed to `htpasswd` in a call to `system()` without validation.  This module has been tested successfully on Xymon version 4.3.10 on Debian 6.",
