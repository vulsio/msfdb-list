    "Title": "Internet Explorer Iframe Sandbox File Name Disclosure Vulnerability",
    "Description": "It was found that Internet Explorer allows the disclosure of local file names. This issue exists due to the fact that Internet Explorer behaves different for file:// URLs pointing to existing and non-existent files. When used in combination with HTML5 sandbox iframes it is possible to use this behavior to find out if a local file exists. This technique only works on Internet Explorer 10 & 11 since these support the HTML5 sandbox. Also it is not possible to do this from a regular website as file:// URLs are blocked all together. The attack must be performed locally (works with Internet zone Mark of the Web) or from a share.",
