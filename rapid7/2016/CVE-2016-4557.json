    "Title": "Linux BPF doubleput UAF Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "Linux kernel 4.4 < 4.5.5 extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) does not properly reference count file descriptors, resulting in a use-after-free, which can be abused to escalate privileges. The target system must be compiled with `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL` and must not have `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` set to 1. Note, this module will overwrite the first few lines of `/etc/crontab` with a new cron job. The job will need to be manually removed. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 16.04 (x64) kernel 4.4.0-21-generic (default kernel).",
