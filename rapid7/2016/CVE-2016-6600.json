    "Title": "WebNMS Framework Server Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Description": "This module abuses a vulnerability in WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 that allows an unauthenticated user to upload text files by using a directory traversal attack on the FileUploadServlet servlet. A JSP file can be uploaded that then drops and executes a malicious payload, achieving code execution under the user which the WebNMS server is running. This module has been tested with WebNMS Framework Server 5.2 and 5.2 SP1 on Windows and Linux.",
