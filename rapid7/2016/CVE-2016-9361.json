    "Description": "The Moxa protocol listens on 4800/UDP and will respond to broadcast or direct traffic.  The service is known to be used on Moxa devices in the NPort, OnCell, and MGate product lines.  Many devices with firmware versions older than 2017 or late 2016 allow admin credentials and SNMP read and read/write community strings to be retrieved without authentication. This module is the work of Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos and K. Reid Wightman. Tested on: Moxa NPort 6250 firmware v1.13, MGate MB3170 firmware 2.5, and NPort 5110 firmware 2.6.",

    "Title": "Moxa UDP Device Discovery",
    "Description": "The Moxa protocol listens on 4800/UDP and will respond to broadcast or direct traffic.  The service is known to be used on Moxa devices in the NPort, OnCell, and MGate product lines. A discovery packet compels a Moxa device to respond to the sender with some basic device information that is needed for more advanced functions.  The discovery data is 8 bytes in length and is the most basic example of the Moxa protocol.  It may be sent out as a broadcast (destination 255.255.255.255) or to an individual device. Devices that respond to this query may be vulnerable to serious information disclosure vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2016-9361. The module is the work of Patrick DeSantis of Cisco Talos and is derived from original work by K. Reid Wightman. Tested and validated on a Moxa NPort 6250 with firmware versions 1.13 and 1.15.",
