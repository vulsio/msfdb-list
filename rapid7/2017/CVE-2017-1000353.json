    "Title": "Jenkins CLI Deserialization",
    "Description": "An unauthenticated Java object deserialization vulnerability exists in the CLI component for Jenkins versions `v2.56` and below. The `readFrom` method within the `Command` class in the Jenkins CLI remoting component deserializes objects received from clients without first checking / sanitizing the data. Because of this, a malicious serialized object contained within a serialized `SignedObject` can be sent to the Jenkins endpoint to achieve code execution on the target.",
