    "Description": "This module exploits the .NET deserialization vulnerability within the RadAsyncUpload (RAU) component of Telerik UI ASP.NET AJAX that is identified as CVE-2019-18935. In order to do so the module must upload a mixed mode .NET assembly DLL which is then loaded through the deserialization flaw. Uploading the file requires knowledge of the cryptographic keys used by RAU. The default values used by this module are related to CVE-2017-11317, which once patched randomizes these keys. It is also necessary to know the version of Telerik UI ASP.NET that is running. This version number is in the format YYYY.#(.###)? where YYYY is the year of the release (e.g. '2020.3.915').",
