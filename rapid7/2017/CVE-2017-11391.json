    "Description": "This module exploits the authentication bypass and command injection vulnerability together. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user. The specific flaw exists within the management interface, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. Trend Micro IMSVA product have widget feature which is implemented with PHP. Insecurely configured web server exposes diagnostic.log file, which leads to an extraction of JSESSIONID value from administrator session. Proxy.php files under the mod TMCSS folder takes multiple parameter but the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.",
