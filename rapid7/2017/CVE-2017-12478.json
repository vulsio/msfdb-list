    "Description": "It was discovered that the api/storage web interface in Unitrends Backup (UB) before 10.0.0 has an issue in which one of its input parameters was not validated. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system. UEB v9 runs the api under root privileges and api/storage is vulnerable. UEB v10 runs the api under limited privileges and api/hosts is vulnerable.",
