    "Title": "Samsung SRN-1670D Web Viewer Version 1.0.0.193 Arbitrary File Read and Upload",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in Web Viewer 1.0.0.193 on Samsung SRN-1670D devices. The network_ssl_upload.php file allows remote authenticated attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a filename with a .php extension, which is then accessed via a direct request to the file in the upload/ directory.  To authenticate for this attack, one can obtain web-interface credentials in cleartext by leveraging the existing local file read vulnerability referenced by CVE-2015-8279, which allows remote attackers to read the web interface credentials by sending a request to: cslog_export.php?path=/root/php_modules/lighttpd/sbin/userpw URI.",
