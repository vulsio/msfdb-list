    "Description": "This module exploits a directory traversal vulnerability in Ulterius Server < v1.9.5.0 to download files from the affected host. A valid file path is needed to download a file. Fortunately, Ulterius indexes every file on the system, which can be stored in the following location:  http://ulteriusURL:port/.../fileIndex.db.  This module can download and parse the fileIndex.db file. There is also an option to download a file using a provided path.",
