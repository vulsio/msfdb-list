    "Title": "ALLMediaServer 0.8 Buffer Overflow",
    "Description": "This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in ALLMediaServer 0.8. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the handling of HTTP request.  While the exploit supports DEP bypass via ROP, on Windows 7 the stack pivoting isn't reliable across virtual (VMWare, VirtualBox) and physical environments. Because of this the module isn't using DEP bypass on the Windows 7 SP1 target, where by default DEP is OptIn and AllMediaServer won't run with DEP.",
