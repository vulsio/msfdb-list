    "Title": "DC/OS Marathon UI Docker Exploit",
    "Description": "Utilizing the DCOS Cluster's Marathon UI, an attacker can create a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the docker container. As the docker container executes command as uid 0 it is honored by the host operating system allowing the attacker to edit/create files owed by root. This exploit abuses this to creates a cron job in the '/etc/cron.d/' path of the host server. *Notes: The docker image must be a valid docker image from hub.docker.com. Furthermore the docker container will only deploy if there are resources available in the DC/OS cluster.",
