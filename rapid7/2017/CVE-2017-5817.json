    "Description": "This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerablity in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center before version 7.3 E0504P04. The dbman service allows unauthenticated remote users to restore a user-specified database (OpCode 10007), however the database connection username is not sanitized resulting in command injection, allowing execution of arbitrary operating system commands as SYSTEM. This service listens on TCP port 2810 by default. This module has been tested successfully on iMC PLAT v7.2 (E0403) on Windows 7 SP1 (EN).",
