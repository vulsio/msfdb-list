    "Description": "This module exploits a Second-Order PHP Object Injection vulnerability in Tuleap <= 9.6 which could be abused by authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code with the permissions of the webserver. The vulnerability exists because of the User::getRecentElements() method is using the unserialize() function with data that can be arbitrarily manipulated by a user through the REST API interface. The exploit's POP chain abuses the __toString() method from the Mustache class to reach a call to eval() in the Transition_PostActionSubFactory::fetchPostActions() method.",
