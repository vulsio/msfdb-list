    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges on Juju agent systems running the juju-run agent utility. Juju agent systems running agent tools prior to version 1.25.12, 2.0.x before 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.3, provide a UNIX domain socket to manage software (\"units\") without setting appropriate permissions, allowing unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module has been tested successfully with Juju agent tools versions 1.18.4, 1.25.5 and 1.25.9 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86 deployed by Juju 1.18.1-trusty-amd64 and 1.25.6-trusty-amd64 on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS x86_64.",
