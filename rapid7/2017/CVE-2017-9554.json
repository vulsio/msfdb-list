    "Title": "Synology Forget Password  User Enumeration Scanner",
    "Description": "This module attempts to enumerate users on the Synology NAS by sending GET requests for the forgot password URL. The Synology NAS will respond differently if a user is present or not. These count as login attempts, and the default is 10 logins in 5min to get a permanent block.  Set delay accordingly to avoid this, as default is permanent. Vulnerable DSMs are: DSM 6.1 < 6.1.3-15152 DSM 6.0 < 6.0.3-8754-4 DSM 5.2 < 5.2-5967-04",
