    "Title": "libssh Authentication Bypass Scanner",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass in libssh server code where a USERAUTH_SUCCESS message is sent in place of the expected USERAUTH_REQUEST message. libssh versions 0.6.0 through 0.7.5 and 0.8.0 through 0.8.3 are vulnerable. Note that this module's success depends on whether the server code can trigger the correct (shell/exec) callbacks despite only the state machine's authenticated state being set. Therefore, you may or may not get a shell if the server requires additional code paths to be followed.",
