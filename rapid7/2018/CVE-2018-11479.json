    "Title": "Windscribe WindscribeService Named Pipe Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "The Windscribe VPN client application for Windows makes use of a Windows service `WindscribeService.exe` which exposes a named pipe `\\\\.\\pipe\\WindscribeService` allowing execution of programs with elevated privileges. Windscribe versions prior to 1.82 do not validate user-supplied program names, allowing execution of arbitrary commands as SYSTEM. This module has been tested successfully on Windscribe versions 1.80 and 1.81 on Windows 7 SP1 (x64).",
