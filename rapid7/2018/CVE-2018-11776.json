    "Description": "This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Apache Struts version 2.3 - 2.3.4, and 2.5 - 2.5.16. Remote Code Execution can be performed via an endpoint that makes use of a redirect action.  Note that this exploit is dependant on the version of Tomcat running on the target.  Versions of Tomcat starting with 7.0.88 currently don't support payloads larger than ~7.5kb.  Windows Meterpreter sessions on Tomcat >=7.0.88 are currently not supported.  Native payloads will be converted to executables and dropped in the server's temp dir. If this fails, try a cmd/* payload, which won't have to write to the disk.",
