    "Title": "Pimcore Gather Credentials via SQL Injection",
    "Description": "This module extracts the usernames and hashed passwords of all users of the Pimcore web service by exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability in Pimcore's REST API.  Pimcore begins to create password hashes by concatenating a user's username, the name of the application, and the user's password in the format USERNAME:pimcore:PASSWORD.  The resulting string is then used to generate an MD5 hash, and then that MD5 hash is used to create the final hash, which is generated using PHP's built-in password_hash function.",
