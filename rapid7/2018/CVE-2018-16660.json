    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Imperva SecureSphere 13.x. The vulnerability exists in the PWS service, where Python CGIs didn't properly sanitize user supplied command parameters and directly passes them to corresponding CLI utility, leading to command injection. Agent registration credential is required to exploit SecureSphere in gateway mode. This module was successfully tested on Imperva SecureSphere 13.0/13.1/ 13.2 in pre-ftl mode and unsealed gateway mode.",
