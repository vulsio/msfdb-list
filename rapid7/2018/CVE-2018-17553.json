    "Description": "This module exploits insufficient sanitization in the database::protect method, of Navigate CMS versions 2.8 and prior, to bypass authentication.  The module then uses a path traversal vulnerability in navigate_upload.php that allows authenticated users to upload PHP files to arbitrary locations. Together these vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code remotely.  This module was tested against Navigate CMS 2.8.",
