    "Title": "Nuuo Central Management Authenticated SQL Server SQLi",
    "Description": "The Nuuo Central Management Server allows an authenticated user to query the state of the alarms. This functionality can be abused to inject SQL into the query. As SQL Server 2005 Express is installed by default, xp_cmdshell can be enabled and abused to achieve code execution. This module will either use a provided session number (which can be guessed with an auxiliary module) or attempt to login using a provided username and password - it will also try the default credentials if nothing is provided.",
