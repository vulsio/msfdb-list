    "Description": "The Wordpress GDPR Compliance plugin <= v1.4.2 allows unauthenticated users to set wordpress administration options by overwriting values within the database.  The vulnerability is present in WordPressâ€™s admin-ajax.php, which allows unauthorized users to trigger handlers and make configuration changes because of a failure to do capability checks when executing the 'save_setting' internal action.  WARNING: The module sets Wordpress configuration options without reading their current values and restoring them later.",
