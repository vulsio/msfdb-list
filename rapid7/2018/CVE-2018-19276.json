    "Description": "OpenMRS is an open-source platform that supplies users with a customizable medical record system. There exists an object deserialization vulnerability in the `webservices.rest` module used in OpenMRS Platform. Unauthenticated remote code execution can be achieved by sending a malicious XML payload to a Rest API endpoint such as `/ws/rest/v1/concept`. This module uses an XML payload generated with Marshalsec that targets the ImageIO component of the XStream library. Tested on OpenMRS Platform `v2.1.2` and `v2.21` with Java 8 and Java 9.",
