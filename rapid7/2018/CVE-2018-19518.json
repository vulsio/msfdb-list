    "Title": "php imap_open Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "The imap_open function within php, if called without the /norsh flag, will attempt to preauthenticate an IMAP session.  On Debian based systems, including Ubuntu, rsh is mapped to the ssh binary.  Ssh's ProxyCommand option can be passed from imap_open to execute arbitrary commands. While many custom applications may use imap_open, this exploit works against the following applications: e107 v2, prestashop, SuiteCRM, as well as Custom, which simply prints the exploit strings for use. Prestashop exploitation requires the admin URI, and administrator credentials. suiteCRM/e107 require administrator credentials.  Fixed in php 5.6.39.",
