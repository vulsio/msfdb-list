    "Title": "Safari Proxy Object Type Confusion",
    "Description": "This module exploits a type confusion bug in the Javascript Proxy object in WebKit. The DFG JIT does not take into account that, through the use of a Proxy, it is possible to run arbitrary JS code during the execution of a CreateThis operation. This makes it possible to change the structure of e.g. an argument without causing a bailout, leading to a type confusion (CVE-2018-4233).  The JIT region is then replaced with shellcode which loads the second stage. The second stage exploits a logic error in libxpc, which uses command execution via the launchd's \"spawn_via_launchd\" API (CVE-2018-4404).",
