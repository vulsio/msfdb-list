    "Title": "Unitrends Enterprise Backup bpserverd Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "It was discovered that the Unitrends bpserverd proprietary protocol, as exposed via xinetd, has an issue in which its authentication can be bypassed.  A remote attacker could use this issue to execute arbitrary commands with root privilege on the target system. This is very similar to exploits/linux/misc/ueb9_bpserverd however it runs against the localhost by dropping a python script on the local file system.  Unitrends stopped bpserverd from listening remotely on version 10.",
