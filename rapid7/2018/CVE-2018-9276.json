    "Title": "PRTG Network Monitor Authenticated RCE",
    "Description": "Notifications can be created by an authenticated user and can execute scripts when triggered. Due to a poorly validated input on the script name, it is possible to chain it with a user-supplied command allowing command execution under the context of privileged user. The module uses provided credentials to log in to the web interface, then creates and triggers a malicious notification to perform RCE using a Powershell payload. It may require a few tries to get a shell because notifications are queued up on the server. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 18.2.39. See references for more details about the vulnerability allowing RCE.",
