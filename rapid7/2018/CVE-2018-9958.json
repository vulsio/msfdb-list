    "Title": "Foxit PDF Reader Pointer Overwrite UAF",
    "Description": "Foxit PDF Reader v9.0.1.1049 has a Use-After-Free vulnerability in the Text Annotations component and the TypedArray's use uninitialized pointers. The vulnerabilities can be combined to leak a vtable memory address, which can be adjusted to point to the base address of the executable. A ROP chain can be constructed that will execute when Foxit Reader performs the UAF. This module has been tested on Windows 7 x64, Windows 10 Pro x64 Build 17134, and Windows 10 Enterprise x64. Windows 10 Enterprise must have insecure logons enabled for the exploit to work as expected.",
