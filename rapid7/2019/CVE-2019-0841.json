    "Title": "AppXSvc Hard Link Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "There exists a privilege escalation vulnerability for Windows 10 builds prior to build 17763. Due to the AppXSvc's improper handling of hard links, a user can gain full privileges over a SYSTEM-owned file. The user can then utilize the new file to execute code as SYSTEM.  This module employs a technique using the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service (DiagHub) which was discovered by James Forshaw to load and execute a DLL as SYSTEM.",
