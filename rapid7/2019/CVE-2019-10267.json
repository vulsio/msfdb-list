    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated insecure file upload and code execution flaw in Ahsay Backup v7.x - v8.1.1.50. To succesfully execute the upload credentials are needed, default on Ahsay Backup trial accounts are enabled so an account can be created. It can be exploited in Windows and Linux environments to get remote code execution (usualy as SYSTEM). This module has been tested successfully on Ahsay Backup v8.1.1.50 with Windows 2003 SP2 Server. Because of this flaw all connected clients can be configured to execute a command before the backup starts. Allowing an attacker to takeover even more systems and make it rain shells! Setting the CREATEACCOUNT to true will create a new account, this is enabled by default. If credeantials are known enter these and run the exploit.",
