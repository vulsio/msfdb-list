    "Title": "Grandstream GXV31XX 'settimezone' Unauthenticated Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Grandstream GXV31XX IP multimedia phones. The 'settimezone' action does not validate input in the 'timezone' parameter allowing injection of arbitrary commands. A buffer overflow in the 'phonecookie' cookie parsing allows authentication to be bypassed by providing an alphanumeric cookie 93 characters in length. This module was tested successfully on Grandstream models: GXV3175v2 hardware revision V2.6A with firmware version 1.0.1.19; and GXV3140 hardware revision V0.4B with firmware version 1.0.1.27.",
