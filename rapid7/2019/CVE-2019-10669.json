    "Title": "LibreNMS Collectd Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Collectd graphing functionality in LibreNMS. The `to` and `from` parameters used to define the range for a graph are sanitized using the `mysqli_escape_real_string()` function, which permits backticks. These parameters are used as part of a shell command that gets executed via the `passthru()` function, which can result in code execution.",
