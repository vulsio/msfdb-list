    "Title": "FusionPBX Operator Panel exec.php Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in FusionPBX versions 4.4.3 and prior. The `exec.php` file within the Operator Panel permits users with `operator_panel_view` permissions, or administrator permissions, to execute arbitrary commands as the web server user by sending a `system` command to the FreeSWITCH event socket interface. This module has been tested successfully on FusionPBX version 4.4.1 on Ubuntu 19.04 (x64).",
