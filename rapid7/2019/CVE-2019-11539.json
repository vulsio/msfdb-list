The env(1) command is used to bypass application whitelisting and run arbitrary commands.  Please see related module auxiliary/gather/pulse_secure_file_disclosure for a pre-auth file read that is able to obtain plaintext and hashed credentials, plus session IDs that may be used with this exploit.  A valid administrator session ID is required in lieu of untested SSRF.",
