    "Description": "This module exploits the trusted `$PATH` environment variable of the SUID binary `omniresolve` in Micro Focus (HPE) Data Protector A.10.40 and prior. The `omniresolve` executable calls the `oracleasm` binary using a relative path and the trusted environment `$PATH`, which allows an attacker to execute a custom binary with `root` privileges. This module has been successfully tested on: HPE Data Protector A.09.07: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 110, built on Thu Aug 11 14:52:38 2016; Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.40: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 118, built on Tue May 21 05:49:04 2019 on CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core) The vulnerability has been patched in: Micro Focus Data Protector A.10.40: OMNIRESOLVE, internal build 125, built on Mon Aug 19 19:22:20 2019",
