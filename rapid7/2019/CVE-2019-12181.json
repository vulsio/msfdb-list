    "Title": "Serv-U FTP Server prepareinstallation Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "This module attempts to gain root privileges on systems running Serv-U FTP Server versions prior to 15.1.7.  The `Serv-U` executable is setuid `root`, and uses `ARGV[0]` in a call to `system()`, without validation, when invoked with the `-prepareinstallation` flag, resulting in command execution with root privileges.  This module has been tested successfully on Serv-U FTP Server version 15.1.6 (x64) on Debian 9.6 (x64).",
