    "Description": "The module detects the version of Nagios XI applications and suggests matching exploit modules based on the version number. Since Nagios XI applications only reveal the version to authenticated users, valid credentials for a Nagios XI account are required. Alternatively, it is possible to provide a specific Nagios XI version number via the `VERSION` option. In that case, the module simply suggests matching exploit modules and does not probe the target(s).",

    "Title": "Nagios XI Authenticated Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Nagios XI before 5.6.6 in order to execute arbitrary commands as root. The module uploads a malicious plugin to the Nagios XI server and then executes this plugin by issuing an HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.6.5 running on CentOS 7. The module may behave differently against older versions of Nagios XI. See the documentation for more information.",
