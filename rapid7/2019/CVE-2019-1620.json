    "Description": "DCNM exposes a file upload servlet (FileUploadServlet) at /fm/fileUpload. An authenticated user can abuse this servlet to upload a WAR to the Apache Tomcat webapps directory and achieve remote code execution as root. This module exploits two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2019-1619 for authentication bypass on versions 10.4(2) and below, and CVE-2019-1622 (information disclosure) to obtain the correct directory for the WAR file upload. This module was tested on the DCNM Linux virtual appliance 10.4(2), 11.0(1) and 11.1(1), and should work on a few versions below 10.4(2). Only version 11.0(1) requires authentication to exploit (see References to understand why).",
