    "Title": "Cisco RV110W/RV130(W)/RV215W Routers Management Interface Remote Command Execution",
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to a targeted device.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user.  RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall versions prior to 1.2.2.1 are affected. RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router versions prior to 1.0.3.45 are affected. RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router versions prior to 1.3.1.1 are affected.  Note: successful exploitation may not result in a session, and as such, on_new_session will never repair the HTTP server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
