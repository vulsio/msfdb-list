    "Title": "Android Binder Use-After-Free Exploit",
    "Description": "This module exploits CVE-2019-2215, which is a use-after-free in Binder in the Android kernel. The bug is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows for a full compromise of a vulnerable device. If chained with a browser renderer exploit, this bug could fully compromise a device through a malicious website. The freed memory is replaced with an iovec structure in order to leak a pointer to the task_struct. Finally the bug is triggered again in order to overwrite the addr_limit, making all memory (including kernel memory) accessible as part of the user-space memory range in our process and allowing arbitrary reading and writing of kernel memory.",
