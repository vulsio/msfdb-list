    "Title": "WP Database Backup RCE",
    "Description": "There exists a command injection vulnerability in the Wordpress plugin `wp-database-backup` for versions < 5.2. For the backup functionality, the plugin generates a `mysqldump` command to execute. The user can choose specific tables to exclude from the backup by setting the `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter in a POST request to the `wp-database-backup` page. The names of the excluded tables are included in the `mysqldump` command unsanitized. Arbitrary commands injected through the `wp_db_exclude_table` parameter are executed each time the functionality for creating a new database backup are run. Authentication is required to successfully exploit this vulnerability.",
