    "Title": "Solaris xscreensaver log Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in `xscreensaver` versions since 5.06 on unpatched Solaris 11 systems which allows users to gain root privileges. `xscreensaver` allows users to create a user-owned file at any location on the filesystem using the `-log` command line argument introduced in version 5.06. This module uses `xscreensaver` to create a log file in `/usr/lib/secure/`, overwrites the log file with a shared object, and executes the shared object using the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable. This module has been tested successfully on: xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.1 (x86); and xscreensaver version 5.15 on Solaris 11.3 (x86).",
