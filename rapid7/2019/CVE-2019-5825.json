    "Title": "Google Chrome 72 and 73 Array.map exploit",
    "Description": "This module exploits an issue in Chrome 73.0.3683.86 (64 bit). The exploit corrupts the length of a float in order to modify the backing store of a typed array. The typed array can then be used to read and write arbitrary memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, so the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.",
