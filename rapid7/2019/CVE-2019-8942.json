    "Description": "This module exploits a path traversal and a local file inclusion vulnerability on WordPress versions 5.0.0 and <= 4.9.8. The crop-image function allows a user, with at least author privileges, to resize an image and perform a path traversal by changing the _wp_attached_file reference during the upload. The second part of the exploit will include this image in the current theme by changing the _wp_page_template attribute when creating a post.  This exploit module only works for Unix-based systems currently.",
