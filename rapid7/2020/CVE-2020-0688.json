    "Title": "Exchange Control Panel ViewState Deserialization",
    "Description": "This module exploits a .NET serialization vulnerability in the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) web page. The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Exchange Server not randomizing the keys on a per-installation basis resulting in them using the same validationKey and decryptionKey values. With knowledge of these values, an attacker can craft a special ViewState to cause an OS command to be executed by NT_AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM using .NET deserialization.",
