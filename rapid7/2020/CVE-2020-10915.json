    "Description": "This module exploits a .NET deserialization vulnerability in the Veeam ONE Agent before the hotfix versions 9.5.5.4587 and 10.0.1.750 in the 9 and 10 release lines.  Specifically, the module targets the HandshakeResult() method used by the Agent. By inducing a failure in the handshake, the Agent will deserialize untrusted data.  Tested against the pre-patched release of 10.0.0.750. Note that Veeam continues to distribute this version but with the patch pre-applied.",
