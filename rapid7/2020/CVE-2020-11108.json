    "Title": "Pi-Hole heisenbergCompensator Blocklist OS Command Execution",
    "Description": "This exploits a command execution in Pi-Hole <= 4.4.  A new blocklist is added, and then an update is forced (gravity) to pull in the blocklist content.  PHP content is then written to a file within the webroot.  Phase 1 writes a sudo pihole command to launch teleporter, effectively running a priv esc.  Phase 2 writes our payload to teleporter.php, overwriting, the content.  Lastly, the phase 1 PHP file is called in the web root, which launches our payload in teleporter.php with root privileges.",
