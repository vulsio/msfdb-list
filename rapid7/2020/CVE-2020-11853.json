    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated Java deserialization that affects a truckload of Micro Focus products: Operations Bridge Manager, Application Performance Management, Data Center Automation, Universal CMDB, Hybrid Cloud Management and Service Management Automation. However this module was only tested on Operations Bridge Manager. Exploiting this vulnerability will result in remote code execution as the root user on Linux or the SYSTEM user on Windows. Authentication is required, the module user needs to login to the application and obtain the authenticated LWSSO_COOKIE_KEY, which should be fed to the module. Any authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability, even the lowest privileged ones. For more information refer to the advisory link below.",

    "Title": "Micro Focus UCMDB Java Deserialization Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits two vulnerabilities, that when chained allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution in Micro Focus UCMDB. UCMDB included in versions 2020.05 and below of Operations Bridge Manager are affected, but this module can probably also be used to exploit Operations Bridge Manager (containerized) and Application Performance Management. Check the advisory and module documentation for details. The first vulnerability is a hardcoded password for the \"diagnostics\" user, which allows us to login to UCMDB. The second vulnerability is a run-of-the-mill Java deserialization, which can be exploited with ysoserial's CommonsBeanutils1 payload. Both Windows and Linux installations are vulnerable.",
