    "Title": "Micro Focus UCMDB Java Deserialization Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits two vulnerabilities, that when chained allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution in Micro Focus UCMDB. UCMDB included in versions 2020.05 and below of Operations Bridge Manager are affected, but this module can probably also be used to exploit Operations Bridge Manager (containerized) and Application Performance Management. Check the advisory and module documentation for details. The first vulnerability is a hardcoded password for the \"diagnostics\" user, which allows us to login to UCMDB. The second vulnerability is a run-of-the-mill Java deserialization, which can be exploited with ysoserial's CommonsBeanutils1 payload. Both Windows and Linux installations are vulnerable.",
