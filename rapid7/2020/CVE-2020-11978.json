    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability by combining two critical vulnerabilities in Apache Airflow 1.10.10. The first, CVE-2020-11978, is an authenticated command injection vulnerability found in one of Airflow's example DAGs, \"example_trigger_target_dag\", which allows any authenticated user to run arbitrary OS commands as the user running Airflow Worker/Scheduler. The second, CVE-2020-13927, is a default setting of Airflow 1.10.10 that allows unauthenticated access to Airflow's Experimental REST API to perform malicious actions such as creating the vulnerable DAG above. The two CVEs taken together allow vulnerable DAG creation and command injection, leading to unauthenticated remote code execution.",
