    "Title": "Aerospike Database UDF Lua Code Execution",
    "Description": "Aerospike Database versions before 5.1.0.3 permitted user-defined functions (UDF) to call the `os.execute` Lua function. This module creates a UDF utilising this function to execute arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of the user running the Aerospike service. This module does not support authentication; however Aerospike Database Community Edition does not enable authentication by default. This module has been tested successfully on Ubuntu with Aerospike Database Community Edition versions 4.9.0.5, 4.9.0.11 and 5.0.0.10.",
