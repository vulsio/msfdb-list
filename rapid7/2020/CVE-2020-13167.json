    "Title": "Netsweeper WebAdmin unixlogin.php Python Code Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a Python code injection in the Netsweeper WebAdmin component's unixlogin.php script, for versions 6.4.4 and prior, to execute code as the root user.  Authentication is bypassed by sending a random whitelisted Referer header in each request.  Tested on the CentOS Linux-based Netsweeper 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 ISOs. Though the advisory lists 6.4.3 and prior as vulnerable, 6.4.4 has been confirmed exploitable.",
