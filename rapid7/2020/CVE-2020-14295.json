    "Description": "This module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in Cacti 1.2.12 and before. An admin can exploit the filter variable within color.php to pull arbitrary values as well as conduct stacked queries. With stacked queries, the path_php_binary value is changed within the settings table to a payload, and an update is called to execute the payload. After calling the payload, the value is reset.",
