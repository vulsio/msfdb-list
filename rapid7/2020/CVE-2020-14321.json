    "Title": "Moodle Teacher Enrollment Privilege Escalation to RCE",
    "Description": "Moodle version 3.9, 3.8 to 3.8.3, 3.7 to 3.7.6, 3.5 to 3.5.12 and earlier unsupported versions allow for a teacher to exploit chain to RCE.  A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class).  After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account.  Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin.  Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme.  Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9",
