    "Title": "Mida Solutions eFramework ajaxreq.php Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Mida Solutions eFramework version 2.9.0 and prior. The `ajaxreq.php` file allows unauthenticated users to inject arbitrary commands in the `PARAM` parameter to be executed as the apache user. The sudo configuration permits the apache user to execute any command as root without providing a password, resulting in privileged command execution as root. This module has been successfully tested on Mida Solutions eFramework-C7-2.9.0 virtual appliance.",
