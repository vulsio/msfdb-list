    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Exchange Server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the target user must have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role assigned and an active mailbox. If the user is in the \"Compliance Management\" or greater \"Organization Management\" role groups, then they have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role. Since the user who installed Exchange is in the \"Organization Management\" role group, they transitively have the \"Data Loss Prevention\" role. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the New-DlpPolicy cmdlet. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied template data when creating a DLP policy. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Tested against Exchange Server 2016 CU14 on Windows Server 2016.",
