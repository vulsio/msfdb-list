    "Title": "Apache Struts 2 Forced Multi OGNL Evaluation",
    "Description": "The Apache Struts framework, when forced, performs double evaluation of attributes' values assigned to certain tags attributes such as id. It is therefore possible to pass in a value to Struts that will be evaluated again when a tag's attributes are rendered. With a carefully crafted request, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is application dependant. A server side template must make an affected use of request data to render an HTML tag attribute.",
