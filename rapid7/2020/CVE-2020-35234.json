    "Title": "WordPress Easy WP SMTP Password Reset",
    "Description": "Wordpress plugin Easy WP SMTP versions <= 1.4.2 was found to not include index.html within its plugin folder. This potentially allows for directory listings.  If debug mode is also enabled for the plugin, all SMTP commands are stored in a debug file.  An email must have been sent from the system as well to create the debug file.  If an email hasn't been sent (Test Email function not included), Aggressive can bypass the last check. Combining these items, it's possible to request a password reset for an account, then view the debug file to determine the link that was emailed out, and reset the user's password.",
