    "Title": "Cockpit CMS NoSQLi to RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits two NoSQLi vulnerabilities to retrieve the user list, and password reset tokens from the system.  Next, the USER is targetted to reset their password. Then a command injection vulnerability is used to execute the payload. While it is possible to upload a payload and execute it, the command injection provides a no disk write method which is more stealthy. Cockpit CMS 0.10.0 - 0.11.1, inclusive, contain all the necessary vulnerabilities for exploitation.",
