    "Title": "WordPress Total Upkeep Unauthenticated Backup Downloader",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated database backup vulnerability in WordPress plugin 'Boldgrid-Backup' also known as 'Total Upkeep' version < 1.14.10. First, `env-info.php` is read to get server information.  Next, `restore-info.json` is read to retrieve the last backup file.  That backup is then downloaded, and any sql files will be parsed looking for the wp_users INSERT statement to grab user creds.",
