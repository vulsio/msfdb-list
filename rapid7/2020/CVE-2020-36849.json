    "Description": "The AIT CSV Import/Export plugin <= 3.0.3 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.  The upload-handler does not require authentication, nor validates the uploaded content.  It may return an error when attempting to parse a CSV, however the uploaded shell is left.  The shell is uploaded to wp-content/uploads/.  The plugin is not required to be activated to be exploitable.",
