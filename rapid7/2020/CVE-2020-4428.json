    "Title": "IBM Data Risk Manager Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains three vulnerabilities that can be chained by an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution as root. The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a command injection as the server user, and finally abuse of an insecure default password. This module exploits all three vulnerabilities, giving the attacker a root shell. At the time of disclosure, this is a 0day. Versions 2.0.3 and below are confirmed to be affected, and the latest 2.0.6 is most likely affected too.",
