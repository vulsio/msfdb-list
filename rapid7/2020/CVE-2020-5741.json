    "Title": "Plex Unpickle Dict Windows RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated Python unsafe pickle.load of a Dict file.  An authenticated attacker can create a photo library and add arbitrary files to it.  After setting the Windows only Plex variable LocalAppDataPath to the newly created photo library, a file named Dict will be unpickled, which causes an RCE as the user who started Plex. Plex_Token is required, to get it you need to log-in through a web browser, then check the requests to grab the X-Plex-Token header.  See info -d for additional details. If an exploit fails, or is cancelled, Dict is left on disk, a new ALBUM_NAME will be required as subsuquent writes will make Dict-1, and not execute.",
