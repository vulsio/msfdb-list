    "Description": "The module detects the version of Nagios XI applications and suggests matching exploit modules based on the version number. Since Nagios XI applications only reveal the version to authenticated users, valid credentials for a Nagios XI account are required. Alternatively, it is possible to provide a specific Nagios XI version number via the `VERSION` option. In that case, the module simply suggests matching exploit modules and does not probe the target(s).",

    "Description": "This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in includes/components/nxti/index.php that enables an authenticated user with admin privileges to achieve remote code execution as the `apache` user. The module uploads a simple PHP shell via includes/components/nxti/index.php to includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/<php_shell> and then executes the payload as the `apache` user via an HTTP GET request to includes/components/autodiscovery/jobs/<php_shell>?<php_param>=<cmd> Valid credentials for a Nagios XI admin user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Nagios XI 5.7.3 running on CentOS 7.",
