    "Title": "Google Chrome 80 JSCreate side-effect type confusion exploit",
    "Description": "This module exploits an issue in Google Chrome 80.0.3987.87 (64 bit). The exploit corrupts the length of a float array (float_rel), which can then be used for out of bounds read and write on adjacent memory. The relative read and write is then used to modify a UInt64Array (uint64_aarw) which is used for read and writing from absolute memory. The exploit then uses WebAssembly in order to allocate a region of RWX memory, which is then replaced with the payload shellcode. The payload is executed within the sandboxed renderer process, so the browser must be run with the --no-sandbox option for the payload to work correctly.",
