    "Description": "A remotely exploitable vulnerability exists within HPE System Insight Manager (SIM) version 7.6.x that can be leveraged by a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code within the context of HPE System Insight Manager's hpsimsvc.exe process, which runs with administrative privileges. The vulnerability occurs due to a failure to validate data during the deserialization process when a user submits a POST request to the /simsearch/messagebroker/amfsecure page. This module exploits this vulnerability by leveraging an outdated copy of Commons Collection, namely 3.2.2, that ships with HPE SIM, to gain RCE as the administrative user running HPE SIM.",
