    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated SQLi in Cayin xPost <=2.5.  The wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp file's wayfinder_seqid parameter can be injected with a blind SQLi.  Since this app bundles MySQL and apache Tomcat the environment is pretty static and therefore the default settings should work.  Results in SYSTEM level access. Only the java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp and java/jsp_shell_bind_tcp payloads seem to be valid.",
