    "Title": "Cayin CMS NTP Server RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated RCE in Cayin CMS <= 11.0. The RCE is executed in the system_service.cgi file's ntpIp Parameter. The field is limited in size, so repeated requests are made to achieve a larger payload. Cayin CMS-SE is built for Ubuntu 16.04 (20.04 failed to install correctly), so the environment should be pretty set and not dynamic between targets. Results in root level access.",
