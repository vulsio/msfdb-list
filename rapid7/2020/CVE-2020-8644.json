    "Title": "PlaySMS index.php Unauthenticated Template Injection Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits a preauth Server-Side Template Injection vulnerability that leads to remote code execution in PlaySMS before version 1.4.3. This issue is caused by double processing a server-side template with a custom PHP template system called 'TPL' which is used in the PlaySMS template engine at `src/Playsms/Tpl.php:_compile()`. The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker supplied username with a malicious payload is submitted. This malicious payload is then stored in a TPL template which when rendered a second time, results in code execution. The TPL(https://github.com/antonraharja/tpl) template language is vulnerable to PHP code injection.  This module was tested against PlaySMS 1.4 on HackTheBox's Forlic Machine.",
