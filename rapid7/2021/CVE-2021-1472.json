    "Title": "Cisco Small Business RV Series Authentication Bypass and Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass (CVE-2021-1472) and command injection (CVE-2021-1473) in the Cisco Small Business RV series of VPN/routers. The device does not adequately verify the credentials in the HTTP Authorization field when requests are made to the /upload endpoint. Then the upload.cgi binary will use the contents of the HTTP Cookie field as part of a `curl` request aimed at an internal endpoint. The curl request is executed using `popen` and allows the attacker to inject commands via the Cookie field. A remote and unauthenticated attacker using this module is able to achieve code execution as `www-data`. This module affects the RV340, RV340w, RV345, and RV345P using firmware versions 1.0.03.20 and below.",
