    "Title": "Win32k ConsoleControl Offset Confusion",
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists within win32k that can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. The flaw exists in how the WndExtra field of a window can be manipulated into being treated as an offset despite being populated by an attacker-controlled value. This can be leveraged to achieve an out of bounds write operation, eventually leading to privilege escalation.",
