    "Title": "Git LFS Clone Command Exec",
    "Description": "Git clients that support delay-capable clean / smudge filters and symbolic links on case-insensitive file systems are vulnerable to remote code execution while cloning a repository. Usage of clean / smudge filters through Git LFS and a case-insensitive file system changes the checkout order of repository files which enables the placement of a Git hook in the `.git/hooks` directory. By default, this module writes a `post-checkout` script so that the payload will automatically be executed upon checkout of the repository.",
