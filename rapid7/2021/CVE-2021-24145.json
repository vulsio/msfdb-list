    "Description": "This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin Modern Events Calendar < 5.16.5. This is due to an incorrect check of the uploaded file extension. Indeed, by using `text/csv` content-type in a request, it is possible to upload a .php payload as is is not forbidden by the plugin. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/<random_payload_name>.php`",
