    "Description": "This module allows an attacker with a privileged Wordpress account to launch a reverse shell due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in Wordpress plugin SP Project & Document < 4.22. The security check only searches for lowercase file extensions such as `.php`, making it possible to upload `.pHP` files for instance. Finally, the uploaded payload can be triggered by a call to `/wp-content/uploads/sp-client-document-manager/<user_id>/<random_payload_name>.php`",
