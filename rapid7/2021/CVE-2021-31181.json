    "Description": "The EditingPageParser.VerifyControlOnSafeList method fails to properly validate user supplied data. This can be leveraged by an attacker to leak sensitive information in rendered-preview content. This module will leak the ViewState validation key and then use it to sign a crafted object that will trigger code execution when deserialized. Tested against SharePoint 2019 and SharePoint 2016, both on Windows Server 2016.",
