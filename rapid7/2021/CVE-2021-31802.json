    "Title": "Netgear R7000 backup.cgi Heap Overflow RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits a heap buffer overflow in the genie.cgi?backup.cgi page of Netgear R7000 routers running firmware version 1.0.11.116. Successful exploitation results in unauthenticated attackers gaining code execution as the root user. The exploit utilizes these privileges to enable the telnet server which allows attackers to connect to the target and execute commands as the admin user from within a BusyBox shell. Users can connect to this telnet server by running the command \"telnet *target IP*\".",
