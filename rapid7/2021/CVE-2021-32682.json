    "Title": "elFinder Archive Command Injection",
    "Description": "elFinder versions below 2.1.59 are vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability via its archive functionality. When creating a new zip archive, the `name` parameter is sanitized with the `escapeshellarg()` php function and then passed to the `zip` utility. Despite the sanitization, supplying the `-TmTT` argument as part of the `name` parameter is still permitted and enables the execution of arbitrary commands as the `www-data` user.",
