    "Title": "2021 Ubuntu Overlayfs LPE",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in Ubuntu's implementation of overlayfs. The vulnerability is the result of failing to verify the ability of a user to set the attributes in a running executable. Specifically, when Overlayfs sends the set attributes data to the underlying file system via `vfs_setxattr`, it fails to first verify the data by calling `cap_convert_nscap`. This vulnerability was patched by moving the call to `cap_convert_nscap` into the `vfs_setxattr` function that sets the attribute, forcing verification every time the `vfs_setxattr` is called rather than trusting the data was already verified.",
