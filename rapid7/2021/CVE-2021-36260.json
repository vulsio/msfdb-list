    "Title": "Hikvision IP Camera Unauthenticated Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection in a variety of Hikvision IP cameras (CVE-2021-36260). The module inserts a command into an XML payload used with an HTTP PUT request sent to the `/SDK/webLanguage` endpoint, resulting in command execution as the `root` user. This module specifically attempts to exploit the blind variant of the attack. The module was successfully tested against an HWI-B120-D/W using firmware V5.5.101 build 200408. It was also tested against an unaffected DS-2CD2142FWD-I using firmware V5.5.0 build 170725. Please see the Hikvision advisory for a full list of affected products.",
