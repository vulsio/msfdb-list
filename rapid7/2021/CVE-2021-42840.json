    "Description": "This module exploits an input validation error on the log file extension parameter. It does not properly validate upper/lower case characters. Once this occurs, the application log file will be treated as a php file. The log file can then be populated with php code by changing the username of a valid user, as this info is logged. The php code in the file can then be executed by sending an HTTP request to the log file. A similar issue was reported by the same researcher where a blank file extension could be supplied and the extension could be provided in the file name. This exploit will work on those versions as well, and those references are included.",
