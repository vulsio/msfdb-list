    "Description": "This module exploits the logic in the CartView.php page when crafting a draft email with an attachment. By uploading an attachment for a draft email, the attachment will be placed in the /tmp_attach/ folder of the ChurchInfo web server, which is accessible over the web by any user. By uploading a PHP attachment and then browsing to the location of the uploaded PHP file on the web server, arbitrary code execution as the web daemon user (e.g. www-data) can be achieved.",
