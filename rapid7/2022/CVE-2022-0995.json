    "Name": "cve_2022_0995_watch_queue.rb",
    "Title": "Watch Queue Out of Bounds Write",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel's watch_queue event notification system. It relies on a heap out-of-bounds write in kernel memory. The exploit may fail on the first attempt so multiple attempts may be needed. Note that the exploit can potentially cause a denial of service if multiple failed attemps occur, however this is unlikely.",
