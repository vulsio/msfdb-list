    "Title": "Advantech iView NetworkServlet Command Injection",
    "Description": "Versions of Advantech iView software below `5.7.04.6469` are vulnerable to an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability via the `NetworkServlet` endpoint. The database backup functionality passes a user-controlled parameter, `backup_file` to the `mysqldump` command. The sanitization functionality only tests for SQL injection attempts and directory traversal, so leveraging the `-r` and `-w` `mysqldump` flags permits exploitation. The command injection vulnerability is used to write a payload on the target and achieve remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
