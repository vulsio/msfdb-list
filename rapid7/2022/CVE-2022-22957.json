    "Description": "This module combines two vulnerabilities in order achieve remote code execution in the context of the `horizon` user. The first vulnerability CVE-2022-22956 is an authentication bypass in OAuth2TokenResourceController ACS which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and execute any operation. The second vulnerability CVE-2022-22957 is a JDBC injection RCE specifically in the DBConnectionCheckController class's dbCheck method which allows an attacker to deserialize arbitrary Java objects which can allow remote code execution.",
