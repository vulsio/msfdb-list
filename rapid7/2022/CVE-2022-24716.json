    "Description": "Icingaweb versions from 2.9.0 to 2.9.5 inclusive, and 2.8.0 to 2.8.5 inclusive suffer from an unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered through the icinga-php-thirdparty library, which allows unauthenticated users to retrieve arbitrary files from the targets filesystem via a GET request to /lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/<absolute path to target file on disk> as the user running the Icingaweb server, which will typically be the www-data user. This can then be used to retrieve sensitive configuration information from the target such as the configuration of various services, which may reveal sensitive login or configuration information, the /etc/passwd file to get a list of valid usernames for password guessing attacks, or other sensitive files which may exist as part of additional functionality available on the target server. This module was tested against Icingaweb 2.9.5 running on Docker.",
