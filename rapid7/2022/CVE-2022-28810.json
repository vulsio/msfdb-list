    "Title": "ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus Custom Script Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits the \"custom script\" feature of ADSelfService Plus. The feature was removed in build 6122 as part of the patch for CVE-2022-28810. For purposes of this module, a \"custom script\" is arbitrary operating system command execution. This module uses an attacker provided \"admin\" account to insert the malicious payload into the custom script fields. When a user resets their password or unlocks their account, the payload in the custom script will be executed. The payload will be executed as SYSTEM if ADSelfService Plus is installed as a service, which we believe is the normal operational behavior. This is a passive module because user interaction is required to trigger the payload. This module also does not automatically remove the malicious code from the remote target. Use the \"TARGET_RESET\" operation to remove the malicious custom script when you are done. ADSelfService Plus uses default credentials of \"admin\":\"admin\"",
