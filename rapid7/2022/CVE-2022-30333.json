    "Description": "This module creates a RAR file that exploits CVE-2022-30333, which is a path-traversal vulnerability in unRAR that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system. UnRAR fixed this vulnerability in version 6.12 (open source version 6.1.7). The core issue is that when a symbolic link is unRAR'ed, Windows symbolic links are not properly validated on Linux systems and can therefore write a symbolic link that points anywhere on the filesystem. If a second file in the archive has the same name, it will be written to the symbolic link path.",

    "Description": "This module creates a RAR file that can be emailed to a Zimbra server to exploit CVE-2022-30333. If successful, it plants a JSP-based backdoor in the public web directory, then executes that backdoor. The core vulnerability is a path-traversal issue in unRAR that can extract an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location on a Linux system. This issue is exploitable on the following versions of Zimbra, provided UnRAR version 6.11 or earlier is installed: * Zimbra Collaboration 9.0.0 Patch 24 (and earlier) * Zimbra Collaboration 8.8.15 Patch 31 (and earlier)",
