    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection within Enlightenment's enlightenment_sys binary. This is done by calling the mount command and feeding it paths which meet all of the system requirements, but execute a specific path as well due to a semi-colon being used. This module was tested on Ubuntu 22.04.1 X64 Desktop with enlightenment 0.25.3-1 (current at module write time)",
