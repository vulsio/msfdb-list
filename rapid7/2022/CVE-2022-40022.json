    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in /controller/ping.php. The S100 through S350 (End of Life) models should be vulnerable to unauthenticated exploitation due to a session handling vulnerability. Later models require authentication which is not provided in this module because we can't test it. The command injection vulnerability is patched in the S650 v2.2 (CVE-2022-40022). Run 'check' first to determine if vulnerable. The server limits outbound ports. Ports 25 and 80 TCP were successfully used for SRVPORT and LPORT while testing this module.",
