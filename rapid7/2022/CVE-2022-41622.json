    "Title": "F5 BIG-IP iControl CSRF File Write SOAP API",
    "Description": "This module exploits a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in F5 Big-IP's iControl interface to write an arbitrary file to the filesystem. While any file can be written to any location as root, the exploitability is limited by SELinux; the vast majority of writable locations are unavailable. By default, we write to a script that executes at reboot, which means the payload will execute the next time the server boots. An alternate target - Login - will add a backdoor that executes next time a user logs in interactively. This overwrites a file, but we restore it when we get a session Note that because this is a CSRF vulnerability, it starts a web server, but an authenticated administrator must visit the site, which redirects them to the target.",
