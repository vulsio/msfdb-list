    "Description": "This exploit takes advantage of the StringSubstitutor interpolator class, which is included in the Commons Text library. A default interpolator allows for string lookups that can lead to Remote Code Execution. This is due to a logic flaw that makes the “script”, “dns” and “url” lookup keys interpolated by default, as opposed to what it should be, according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups primarily using the \"script\" key. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities, the following requirements must be met: Run a version of Apache Commons Text from version 1.5 to 1.9 Use the StringSubstitutor interpolator Target should run JDK < 15",
