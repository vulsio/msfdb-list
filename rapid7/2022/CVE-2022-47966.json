Due to a dependency to an outdated library (Apache Santuario version 1.4.1), it is possible to execute arbitrary code by providing a crafted `samlResponse` XML to the ADSelfService Plus SAML endpoint. Note that the target is only vulnerable if it has been configured with SAML-based SSO at least once in the past, regardless of the current SAML-based SSO status.",
