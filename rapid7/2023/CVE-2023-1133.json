    "Title": "Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master Deserialization",
    "Description": "Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions below v1.0.5 have an unauthenticated .NET deserialization vulnerability within the 'ParseUDPPacket()' method of the 'Device-Gateway-Status' process. The 'ParseUDPPacket()' method reads user-controlled packet data and eventually calls 'BinaryFormatter.Deserialize()' on what it determines to be the packet header without appropriate validation, leading to unauthenticated code execution as the user running the 'Device-Gateway-Status' process.",
