    "Title": "Wordpress File Manager Advanced Shortcode 2.3.2 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution through shortcode",
    "Description": "The Wordpress plugin does not adequately prevent uploading files with disallowed MIME types when using the shortcode. This leads to RCE in cases where the allowed MIME type list does not include PHP files. In the worst case, this is available to unauthenticated users, but is also works in an authenticated configuration. File Manager Advanced Shortcode plugin version `2.3.2` and lower are vulnerable. To install the Shortcode plugin File Manager Advanced version `5.0.5` or lower is required to keep the configuration vulnerable. Any user privileges can exploit this vulnerability which results in access to the underlying operating system with the same privileges under which the Wordpress web services run.",
