    "Title": "Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) for WinSock Elevation of Privilege",
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for Winsock (`afd.sys`) can be leveraged by an attacker to escalate privileges to those of NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. Due to a flaw in `AfdNotifyRemoveIoCompletion`, it is possible to create an arbitrary kernel Write-Where primitive, which can be used to manipulate internal I/O ring structures and achieve local privilege escalation. This exploit only supports Windows 11 22H2 up to build 22621.963 (patched in January 2023 updates).",
