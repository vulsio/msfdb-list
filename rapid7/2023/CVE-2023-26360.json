    "Description": "This module exploits a remote unauthenticated deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion 2021 Update 5 and earlier as well as ColdFusion 2018 Update 15 and earlier, in order to read an arbitrary file from the server. To run this module you must provide a valid ColdFusion Component (CFC) endpoint via the CFC_ENDPOINT option, and a valid remote method name from that endpoint via the CFC_METHOD option. By default an endpoint in the ColdFusion Administrator (CFIDE) is provided. If the CFIDE is not accessible you will need to choose a different CFC endpoint, method and parameters.",
