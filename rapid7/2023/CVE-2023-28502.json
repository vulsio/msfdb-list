    "Title": "Rocket Software Unidata udadmin_server Stack Buffer Overflow in Password",
    "Description": "This modlue exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Linux version of udadmin_server, which is an RPC service that comes with the Rocket Software UniData server, which runs as root. This vulnerability affects UniData versions 8.2.4 build 3003 and earlier (for Linux), but this module specifically targets UniData version 8.2.4 build 3001. Other versions will crash the forked process, but will not otherwise affect the RPC server. The username and password fields are copied to a stack-based buffer using a function that's equivalent to strcpy() (ie, has no bounds checking). Additionally, the password field is encoded in such a way that we can include NUL bytes.",
