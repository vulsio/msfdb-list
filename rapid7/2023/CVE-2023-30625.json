    "Title": "Rudder Server SQLI Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This Metasploit module exploits a SQL injection vulnerability in RudderStack's rudder-server, an open source Customer Data Platform (CDP). The vulnerability exists in versions of rudder-server prior to 1.3.0-rc.1. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, which may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to the `rudder` role in PostgreSQL having superuser permissions by default.",
