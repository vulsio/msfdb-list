    "Description": "Some Linksys Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection. You will need credentials to the web interface to access the vulnerable part of the application. Default credentials are always a good starting point. admin/admin or admin and blank password could be a first try. Note: This is a blind OS command injection vulnerability. This means that you will not see any output of your command. Try a ping command to your local system and observe the packets with tcpdump (or equivalent) for a first test. Hint: To get a remote shell you could upload a netcat binary and exec it. WARNING: this module will overwrite network and DHCP configuration.",
