    "Description": "This module exploits the use of unsafe functions in a number of Ubuntu kernels utilizing vunerable versions of overlayfs. To mitigate CVE-2021-3493 the Linux kernel added a call to vfs_setxattr during ovl_do_setxattr. Due to independent changes to the kernel by the Ubuntu development team __vfs_setxattr_noperm is called during ovl_do_setxattr without calling the intermediate safety function vfs_setxattr. Ultimatly this module allows for root access to be achieved by writing setuid capabilities to a file which are not sanitized after being unioned with the upper mounted directory.",
