    "Title": "Microsoft Error Reporting Local Privilege Elevation Vulnerability",
    "Description": "This module takes advantage of a bug in the way Windows error reporting opens the report parser.  If you open a report, Windows uses a relative path to locate the rendering program. By creating a specific alternate directory structure, we can coerce Windows into opening an arbitrary executable as SYSTEM. If the current user is a local admin, the system will attempt impersonation and the exploit will fail.",
