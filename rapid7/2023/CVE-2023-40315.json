    "Description": "This module exploits built-in functionality in OpenNMS Horizon in order to execute arbitrary commands as the opennms user. For versions 32.0.2 and higher, this module requires valid credentials for a user with ROLE_FILESYSTEM_EDITOR privileges and either ROLE_ADMIN or ROLE_REST. For versions 32.0.1 and lower, credentials are required for a user with ROLE_FILESYSTEM_EDITOR, ROLE_REST, and/or ROLE_ADMIN privileges. In that case, the module will automatically escalate privileges via CVE-2023-40315 or CVE-2023-0872 if necessary. This module has been successfully tested against OpenNMS version 31.0.7",
