    "Description": "This exploit module leverages an Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes vulnerability (CVE-2023-43177) to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. This affects CrushFTP versions prior to 10.5.1. It is possible to set some user's session properties by sending an HTTP request with specially crafted Header key-value pairs. This enables an unauthenticated attacker to access files anywhere on the server file system and steal the session cookies of valid authenticated users. The attack consists in hijacking a user's session and escalates privileges to obtain full control of the target. Remote code execution is obtained by abusing the dynamic SQL driver loading and configuration testing feature.",
