    "Description": "This module exploits a flaw in F5's BIG-IP Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI) that enables an external, unauthenticated attacker to create an administrative user. Once the user is created, the module uses the new account to execute a command payload. Both the exploit and check methods automatically delete any temporary accounts that are created.",
