    "Title": "ISPConfig language_edit.php PHP Code Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a PHP code injection vulnerability in ISPConfig's language_edit.php file. The vulnerability occurs when the `admin_allow_langedit` setting is enabled, allowing authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code through the language editor interface. This module will automatically check if the required `admin_allow_langedit` permission is enabled, and attempt to enable it if it's disabled (requires admin credentials with system configuration access). The exploit works by injecting a PHP payload into a language file, which is then executed when the file is accessed. The payload is base64 encoded and written using PHP's file_put_contents function.",
