    "Title": "WordPress Backup Migration Plugin PHP Filter Chain RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauth RCE in the WordPress plugin: Backup Migration (<= 1.3.7).  The vulnerability is exploitable through the Content-Dir header which is sent to the /wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/backup-heart.php endpoint. The exploit makes use of a neat technique called PHP Filter Chaining which allows an attacker to prepend bytes to a string by continuously chaining character encoding conversions. This allows an attacker to prepend a PHP payload to a string which gets evaluated by a require statement, which results in command execution.",
