    "Title": "GitLab Password Reset Account Takeover",
    "Description": "This module exploits an account-take-over vulnerability that allows users to take control of a gitlab account without user interaction. The vulnerability lies in the password reset functionality. Its possible to provide 2 emails and the reset code will be sent to both. It is therefore possible to provide the e-mail address of the target account as well as that of one we control, and to reset the password. 2-factor authentication prevents this vulnerability from being exploitable. There is no discernable difference between a vulnerable and non-vulnerable server response. Vulnerable versions include: 16.1 < 16.1.6, 16.2 < 16.2.9, 16.3 < 16.3.7, 16.4 < 16.4.5, 16.5 < 16.5.6, 16.6 < 16.6.4, and 16.7 < 16.7.2.",
