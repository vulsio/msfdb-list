    "Description": "This module chains an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-4358) with a deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2024-1800) to obtain remote code execution against Telerik Report Server version 10.0.24.130 and prior. The authentication bypass flaw allows an unauthenticated user to create a new user with administrative privileges. The USERNAME datastore option can be used to authenticate with an existing account to prevent the creation of a new one. The deserialization flaw works by uploading a specially crafted report that when loaded will execute an OS command as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. The module will automatically delete the created report but not the account because users are unable to delete themselves.",
