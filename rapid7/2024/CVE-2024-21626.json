    "Title": "runc (docker) File Descriptor Leak Privilege Escalation",
    "Description": "All versions of runc <=1.1.11, as used by containerization technologies such as Docker engine, and Kubernetes are vulnerable to an arbitrary file write. Due to a file descriptor leak it is possible to mount the host file system with the permissions of runc (typically root). Successfully tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with runc 1.1.7-0ubuntu1~22.04.1 and runc 1.1.11 using Docker build. Successfully tested on Debian 12.4.0 with runc 1.1.11 using Docker build. Successfully tested on Arch Linux 12/1/2024 with runc 1.1.10-1 using Docker build.",
