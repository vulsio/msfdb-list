    "Description": "Obtain remote code execution in Palo Alto Expedition version 1.2.91 and below. The first vulnerability, CVE-2024-5910, allows to reset the password of the admin user, and the second vulnerability, CVE-2024-9464, is an authenticated OS command injection. In a default installation, commands will get executed in the context of www-data. When credentials are provided, this module will only exploit the second vulnerability. If no credentials are provided, the module will first try to reset the admin password and then perform the OS command injection.",

    "Description": "Remote Code Execution in Traccar v5.1 - v5.12. Remote code execution can be obtained by combining two vulnerabilities: A path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-24809) and an unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CVE-2024-31214). By default, the application allows self-registration, enabling any user to register an account and exploit the issues. Moreover, the application runs by default with root privileges, potentially resulting in a complete system compromise. This module, which should work on any Red Hat-based Linux system, exploits these issues by adding a new cronjob file that executes the specified payload.",
