    "Description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in JetBrains TeamCity. An unauthenticated attacker can leverage this to access the REST API and create a new administrator access token. This token can be used to upload a plugin which contains a Metasploit payload, allowing the attacker to achieve unauthenticated RCE on the target TeamCity server. On older versions of TeamCity, access tokens do not exist so the exploit will instead create a new administrator account before uploading a plugin. Older version of TeamCity have a debug endpoint (/app/rest/debug/process) that allows for arbitrary commands to be executed, however recent version of TeamCity no longer ship this endpoint, hence why a plugin is leveraged for code execution instead, as this is supported on all versions tested.",
