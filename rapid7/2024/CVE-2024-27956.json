    "Title": "WordPress wp-automatic Plugin SQLi Admin Creation",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the WordPress wp-automatic plugin (versions < 3.92.1) to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands, which can be used to create a malicious administrator account. The password for the new account is hashed using MD5. Once the administrator account is created, the attacker can upload and execute a malicious plugin, leading to full control over the WordPress site.",
