    "Title": "Apache OFBiz forgotPassword/ProgramExport RCE",
    "Description": "Apache OFBiz versions prior to 18.12.13 are vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-32113). The vulnerable endpoint /webtools/control/forgotPassword allows an attacker to access the ProgramExport endpoint which in turn allows for remote code execution in the context of the user running the application. This was patched in 18.12.14. It was then discovered that the use of the path traversal vulnerability is not required in order to access the vulnerable endpoint ProgramExport. CVE-2024-38856 was given for this Incorrect Authorization vulnerability and was patched in 18.12.15. This module was originally written the exploit CVE-2024-32113, but upon the discovery of CVE-2024-38856 the module updated to not exploit the path traversal vulnerability allowing for exploitation on 18.12.14 as well.",
