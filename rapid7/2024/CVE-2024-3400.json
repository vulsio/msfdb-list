    "Title": "Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "This module exploits two vulnerabilities in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS that allow an unauthenticated attacker to create arbitrarily named files and execute shell commands. Configuration requirements are PAN-OS with GlobalProtect Gateway or GlobalProtect Portal enabled and telemetry collection on (default). Affected versions include < 11.1.0-h3, < 11.1.1-h1, < 11.1.2-h3, < 11.0.2-h4, < 11.0.3-h10, < 11.0.4-h1, < 10.2.5-h6, < 10.2.6-h3, < 10.2.8-h3, and < 10.2.9-h1. Payloads may take up to one hour to execute, depending on how often the telemetry service is set to run.",
