    "Description": "This exploit effectively serves as a bypass for CVE-2024-3408. An attacker can override global state to enable custom filters, which then facilitates remote code execution. Specifically, this vulnerability leverages the ability to manipulate global application settings to activate the enable_custom_filters feature, typically restricted to trusted environments. Once enabled, the /test-filter endpoint of the Custom Filters functionality can be exploited to execute arbitrary system commands.",
