    "Title": "Geoserver unauthenticated Remote Code Execution",
    "Description": "GeoServer is an open-source software server written in Java that provides the ability to view, edit, and share geospatial data. It is designed to be a flexible, efficient solution for distributing geospatial data from a variety of sources such as Geographic Information System (GIS) databases, web-based data, and personal datasets. In the GeoServer versions < 2.23.6, >= 2.24.0, < 2.24.4 and >= 2.25.0, < 2.25.1, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions. An attacker can abuse this by sending a POST request with a malicious xpath expression to execute arbitrary commands as root on the system.",
