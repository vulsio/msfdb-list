    "Description": "This Metasploit module exploits a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise (splunk_archiver application). The flaw is rooted in the unsafe use of a Splunk lookup function, specifically | copybuckets, within the splunk_archiver application, which ultimately leads to the execution of the helper script sudobash with attacker-controlled arguments. The affected versions include any release prior to 9.0.10, as well as versions 9.1.2 through 9.1.5 and 9.2.0 through 9.2.2.",
