    "Description": "This module exploits an authentication bypass vulnerability in Telerik Report Server versions 10.0.24.305 and prior which allows an unauthenticated attacker to create a new account with administrative privileges. The vulnerability leverages the initial setup page which is still accessible once the setup process has completed. If either USERNAME or PASSWORD are not specified, then a random value will be selected. The module will fail if the specified USERNAME already exists.",

    "Description": "This module chains an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-4358) with a deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2024-1800) to obtain remote code execution against Telerik Report Server version 10.0.24.130 and prior. The authentication bypass flaw allows an unauthenticated user to create a new user with administrative privileges. The USERNAME datastore option can be used to authenticate with an existing account to prevent the creation of a new one. The deserialization flaw works by uploading a specially crafted report that when loaded will execute an OS command as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. The module will automatically delete the created report but not the account because users are unable to delete themselves.",
