    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated arbitrary file read vulnerability (CVE-2024-45309), which affects OneDev versions <= 11.0.8. To exploit this vulnerability, a valid OneDev project name is required. If anonymous access is enabled on the OneDev server, any visitor can view existing projects without authentication. However, when anonymous access is disabled, an attacker who lacks prior knowledge of existing project names can use a brute-force approach. By providing a user-supplied wordlist, the module may be able to guess a valid project name and subsequently exploit the vulnerability.",
