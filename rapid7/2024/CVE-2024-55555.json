    "Title": "Invoice Ninja unauthenticated PHP Deserialization Vulnerability",
    "Description": "Invoice Ninja is a free invoicing software for small businesses, based on the PHP framework Laravel. A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Invoice Ninja (>= 5.8.22 <= 5.10.10) allows remote unauthenticated attackers to conduct PHP deserialization attacks via endpoint `/route/<hash>` which accepts a Laravel ciphered value which is unsafe unserialized, if an attacker has access to the APP_KEY. As it allows remote code execution, adversaries could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands, potentially resulting in complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
