    "Title": "SPIP Unauthenticated RCE via porte_plume Plugin",
    "Description": "This module exploits a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in SPIP versions up to and including 4.2.12. The vulnerability occurs in SPIPâ€™s templating system where it incorrectly handles user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code. This can be achieved by crafting a payload manipulating the templating data processed by the `echappe_retour()` function, invoking `traitements_previsu_php_modeles_eval()`, which contains an `eval()` call.",
