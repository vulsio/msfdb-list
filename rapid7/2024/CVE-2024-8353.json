    "Title": "GiveWP Unauthenticated Donation Process Exploit",
    "Description": "The GiveWP Donation Plugin and Fundraising Platform for WordPress, in all versions up to and including 3.16.1, is vulnerable to a PHP Object Injection (POI) attack that allows unauthenticated arbitrary code execution. Although a patch was introduced in version 3.14.2, it was incorrect and can be bypassed. This means the vulnerability remains exploitable in subsequent versions due to the ineffective patch.",
