    "Title": "WordPress WP Time Capsule Arbitrary File Upload to RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the WordPress WP Time Capsule plugin (versions <= 1.22.21). The vulnerability allows uploading a malicious PHP file to achieve remote code execution (RCE). The validation logic in the vulnerable function improperly checks for allowed extensions. If no valid extension is found, the check can be bypassed by using a filename of specific length (e.g., \"00.php\") matching the length of allowed extensions like \".crypt\".",
