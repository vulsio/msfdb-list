    "Title": "Gladinet CentreStack/Triofox Path Traversal",
    "Description": "This module exploits a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-11371) in Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. The vulnerability exists in the `/storage/t.dn` endpoint which does not properly sanitize the `s` parameter, allowing path traversal attacks. This can be used to read sensitive files such as Web.config which contains the machineKey used for ViewState deserialization attacks (CVE-2025-30406). Gladinet CentreStack versions up to 16.10.10408.56683 are vulnerable. Gladinet Triofox versions up to 16.10.10408.56683 are vulnerable.",
