    "Title": "WordPress AI Engine Plugin MCP Unauthenticated Admin Creation to RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated vulnerability in the WordPress AI Engine plugin (versions <= 3.1.3). The vulnerability allows an attacker to create an administrator account via the MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint without authentication. The module supports both `/wp-json/mcp/v1/` and `/?rest_route=/mcp/v1/` endpoints. Once an administrator account is created, the module uploads and executes a malicious plugin to achieve remote code execution (RCE).",
