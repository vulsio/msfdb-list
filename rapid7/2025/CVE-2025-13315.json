    "Title": "Twonky Server Log Leak Authentication Bypass",
    "Description": "This module leverages an authentication bypass in Twonky Server 8.5.2. By exploiting an authorization flaw to access a privileged web API endpoint and leak application logs, encrypted administrator credentials are leaked (CVE-2025-13315). The exploit will then decrypt these credentials using hardcoded keys (CVE-2025-13316) and login as the administrator. Expected module output is a username and plain text password for the administrator account.",
