    "Title": "WordPress ACF Extended Unauthenticated RCE via prepare_form()",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Advanced Custom Fields: Extended (ACF Extended) WordPress plugin versions 0.9.0.5 through 0.9.1.1. The vulnerability exists in the prepare_form() function of the acfe_module_form_front_render class, which accepts user-controlled input via the form[render] parameter and passes it directly to call_user_func_array() without proper sanitization. This exploit requires a WordPress page containing an ACF Extended form widget, which exposes the required nonce token in the page's JavaScript. The NONCE_PAGE option must be set to the path of such a page. Once an administrator account is created via wp_insert_user(), the module uploads and executes a malicious plugin to achieve remote code execution (RCE).",
