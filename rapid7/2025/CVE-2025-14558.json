    "Title": "FreeBSD rtsold/rtsol DNSSL Command Injection",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-14558) in FreeBSD's rtsol(8) and rtsold(8) programs. These programs do not validate the domain search list options provided in IPv6 Router Advertisement messages; the option body is passed to resolvconf(8) unmodified. resolvconf(8) is a shell script which does not validate its input. A lack of quoting means that shell commands passed as input to resolvconf(8) may be executed, enabling command injection via $() substitution in the DNSSL domain name fields. This exploit requires Layer 2 adjacency to the target (same network segment) and root privileges to send raw packets. Router advertisement messages are not routable and should be dropped by routers, so the attack does not cross network boundaries.",
