    "Title": "MongoDB Memory Disclosure (CVE-2025-14847) - Mongobleed",
    "Description": "This module exploits a memory disclosure vulnerability in MongoDB's zlib decompression handling (CVE-2025-14847). By sending crafted OP_COMPRESSED messages with inflated BSON document lengths, the server reads beyond the decompressed buffer and returns leaked memory contents in error messages. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to leak server memory which may contain sensitive information such as credentials, session tokens, encryption keys, or other application data.",
