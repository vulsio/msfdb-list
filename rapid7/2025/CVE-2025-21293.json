    "Description": "This module attempts to exploit existing administrative privileges to obtain a SYSTEM session. If directly creating a service fails, this module will inspect existing services to look for insecure configuration, file or registry permissions that may be hijacked. It will then attempt to restart the replaced service to run the payload. This will result in a new session when this succeeds.",
