    "Title": "Xorcom CompletePBX Authenticated File Disclosure via Backup Download",
    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated file disclosure vulnerability in CompletePBX <= 5.2.35. The issue resides in the backup download function, where user input is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the system as root. The vulnerability is triggered by setting the `backup` parameter to a Base64-encoded absolute file path, prefixed by a comma `,`. This results in the server exposing the file contents directly.",
