    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Cacti versions prior to 1.2.29. Authenticated users can upload a graph template through the /graph_templates.php endpoint. The right_axis_label parameter is vulnerable to code injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The payload is length limited, due to this constraint the module starts an HTTP server and hosts the payload. The initial payload downloads the full payload using curl from the attacker's server and saves it to the web root of the cacti server before executing.",
