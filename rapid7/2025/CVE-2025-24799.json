    "Title": "GLPI Inventory Plugin Unauthenticated Blind Boolean SQLi",
    "Description": "GLPI <= 1.0.18 fails to properly sanitize user supplied data when sent inside a `SimpleXMLElement` (available to unauthenticated users), prior to using it in a dynamically constructed SQL query. As a result, unauthenticated attackers can conduct an SQL injection attack to dump sensitive data from the backend database such as usernames and password hashes. In order for GLPI to be exploitable the GLPI Inventory plugin must be installed and enabled, and the \"Enable Inventory\" radio button inside the administration configuration also must be checked.",
