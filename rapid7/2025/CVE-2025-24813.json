    "Title": "Tomcat Partial PUT Java Deserialization",
    "Description": "This module exploits a Java deserialization vulnerability in Apache Tomcat's session restoration functionality that can be exploited with a partial HTTP PUT request to place an attacker controlled deserialization payload in the <tomcat_root_dir>/webapps/ROOT/ directory. For the exploit to succeed, writes must be enabled for the default servlet, and org.apache.catalina.session.PersistentManager must be configured to use org.apache.catalina.session.FileStore. Verified working on 10.1.16-1",
