    "Title": "pgAdmin Query Tool authenticated RCE (CVE-2025-2945)",
    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in pgAdmin where an authenticated user can establish a connection to the query tool and send a specific payload in the query_commited POST parameter. This payload is directly executed via a Python eval() statement, resulting in remote code execution in versions prior to 9.2. To exploit this vulnerability, pgAdmin credentials are required. Additionally, in order to interact with the vulnerable SQL editor component, valid database credentials are necessary to initialize a session and obtain a transaction ID, which is required for the exploit.",
