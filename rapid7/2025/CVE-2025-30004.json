    "Description": "This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability in Xorcom CompletePBX versions <= 5.2.35. The issue resides in the task scheduler functionality, where user-controlled input is improperly sanitized, allowing arbitrary command execution with web server privileges. Only the superadmin user (admin) has the necessary permissions to trigger this exploit. Even when creating a new user with maximum privileges, the vulnerability does not work.",
