    "Title": "Web-Check Screenshot API Command Injection RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in Web-Check's `/api/screenshot` endpoint. The `directChromiumScreenshot()` function uses `child_process.exec()` with unsanitized user input, allowing command injection via URL query parameters. The vulnerability was patched in commit 0e4958aa10b2650d32439a799f6fc83a7cd46cef by replacing `exec()` with `execFile()`.",
