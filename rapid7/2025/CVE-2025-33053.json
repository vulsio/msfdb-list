    "Title": "CVE-2025-33053 Exploit via Malicious .URL File and WebDAV",
    "Description": "This module exploits CVE-2025-33053 by generating a malicious .URL file pointing to a trusted LOLBAS binary with parameters designed to trigger unintended behavior. Optionally, a payload is generated and hosted on a specified WebDAV directory. When the victim opens the shortcut, it will attempt to access the WebDAV path, potentially resulting in remote code execution via a trusted binary.",
