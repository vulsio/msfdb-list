    "Description": "This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS version 3.7.0 and 3.6.* in order to execute arbitrary commands as the user running Bolt. This module first takes advantage of a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to change the username in /bolt/profile to a PHP `system($_GET[\"\"])` variable. Next, the module obtains a list of tokens from `/async/browse/cache/.sessions` and uses these to create files with the blacklisted `.php` extention via HTTP POST requests to `/async/folder/rename`. For each created file, the module checks the HTTP response for evidence that the file can be used to execute arbitrary commands via the created PHP $_GET variable. If the response is negative, the file is deleted, otherwise the payload is executed via an HTTP get request in this format: `/files/<rogue_PHP_file>?<$_GET_var>=<payload>` Valid credentials for a Bolt CMS user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Bolt CMS 3.7.0 running on CentOS 7.",
