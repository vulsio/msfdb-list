    "Description": "This module exploits a vulnerability in VICIdial versions 2.9 RC 1 to 2.13 RC1 which allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary operating system commands as the web server user if password encryption is enabled (disabled by default). When password encryption is enabled the user's password supplied using HTTP basic authentication is used in a call to exec(). This module has been tested successfully on version 2.11 RC2 and 2.13 RC1 on CentOS.",
