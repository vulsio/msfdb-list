    "Title": "Template Injection Vulnerability in Sawtooth Software's Lighthouse Studio (CVE-2025-34300)",
    "Description": "This module exploits a template injection vulnerability in the Sawtooth Software Lighthouse Studio's `ciwweb.pl` web application. The application fails to properly sanitize user input within survey templates, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject and execute arbitrary Perl commands on the target system. This vulnerability affects Lighthouse Studio versions prior to 9.16.14. Successful exploitation may result in remote code execution under the privileges of the web server, potentially exposing sensitive data or disrupting survey operations. An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands in the context of the user running the web server.",
