    "Description": "This module exploits a pre-auth remote code execution vulnerability in SmarterTools SmarterMail before version 100.0.9413. The endpoint /api/upload fails to sanitize the contextData POST parameter which can contain JSON data with a \"guid\" key that allows directory traversal. By leveraging this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious ASPX web shell to the server's web root directory, leading to remote code execution.",
