    "Description": "This module exploits the authentication bypass vulnerabilities CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-53771, and an unsafe deserialization vulnerability CVE-2025-49704, to achieve unauthenticated RCE against a vulnerable Microsoft SharePoint Server. The vulnerability CVE-2025-53770 was disclosed as being a patch bypass of CVE-2025-49704, and as described by the finders, CVE-2025-53770 targets a different endpoint within the /_vti_bin/ URI path. As this exploit module does not target the endpoint associated with CVE-2025-53770 (per the original finders), we believe this module is best described as exploiting CVE-2025-49704 and not CVE-2025-53770.",
