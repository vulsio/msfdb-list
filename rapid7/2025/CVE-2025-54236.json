    "Description": "This module exploits CVE-2025-54236 (SessionReaper), a critical vulnerability in Magento/Adobe Commerce that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. The vulnerability stems from improper handling of nested deserialization in the payment method context, combined with an unauthenticated file upload endpoint. The exploit chain consists of three steps: 1. Upload a malicious PHP session file containing a Guzzle/FW1 deserialization payload via the unauthenticated /customer/address_file/upload endpoint 2. Trigger deserialization by sending a crafted JSON payload to the REST API endpoint /rest/default/V1/guest-carts/{cart_id",
