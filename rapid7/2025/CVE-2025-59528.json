    "Description": "This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Flowise versions >= 2.2.7-patch.1 and < 3.0.6. The vulnerability exists in the customMCP endpoint (/api/v1/node-load-method/customMCP) located in packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts, which allows users to execute arbitrary commands via JavaScript code injection in the mcpServerConfig parameter using the convertToValidJSONString function that uses Function('return ' + inputString)(). For versions < 3.0.1, the exploit can work unauthenticated if FLOWISE_USERNAME and FLOWISE_PASSWORD environment variables are not configured. For versions >= 3.0.1, authentication via FLOWISE_EMAIL and FLOWISE_PASSWORD is required due to JWT token verification.",
