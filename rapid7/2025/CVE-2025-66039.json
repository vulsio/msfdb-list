    "Description": "FreePBX versions prior to 16.0.44,16.0.92 and 17.0.23,17.0.6 are vulnerable to multiple CVEs, specifically CVE-2025-66039 and CVE-2025-61675, in the context of this module. The versions before 16.0.44 and 17.0.23 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-66039, while versions before 16.0.92 and 17.0.6 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-61675. The former represents an authentication bypass: when FreePBX uses Webserver Authorization Mode (an option the admin can enable), it allows an attacker to authenticate as any user. The latter CVE describes multiple SQL injections; this module exploits the SQL injection in the custom extension component. The module chains these vulnerabilities into an unauthenticated SQL injection attack that creates a new administrative user.",

The former represents an authentication bypass: when FreePBX uses Webserver Authorization Mode (an option the admin can enable), it allows an attacker to authenticate as any user. The latter allows unrestricted file uploads via firmware upload, including path traversal. These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated remote code execution by bypassing authentication and placing a webshell in the web server's directory.",
