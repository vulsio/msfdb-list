    "Title": "Grav CMS Twig SSTI Authenticated Sandbox Bypass RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability (CVE-2025-66294) in Grav CMS that allows bypassing the Twig sandbox to achieve remote code execution. The cleanDangerousTwig method uses weak regex that fails to sanitize nested Twig calls within the evaluate_twig function. To inject the payload, this module leverages CVE-2025-66301, a broken access control flaw that allows users with page editing privileges to modify the form's YAML frontmatter process section.",
