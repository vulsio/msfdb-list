    "Title": "WordPress StoryChief Plugin Unauthenticated RCE",
    "Description": "This module exploits an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the StoryChief WordPress plugin <= 1.0.42. The plugin exposes a webhook endpoint at /wp-json/storychief/webhook which accepts a forged HMAC. Because the plugin uses an empty secret for HMAC validation, attackers can compute a valid MAC and force WordPress to download and store attacker-controlled PHP content inside the uploads directory, resulting in remote code execution.",
