    "Description": "This module exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Flowise versions >= 2.2.7-patch.1 and < 3.0.1. The vulnerability exists in the customMCP endpoint (/api/v1/node-load-method/customMCP) located in packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/CustomMCP/CustomMCP.ts and packages/components/nodes/tools/MCP/core.ts, which allows users to execute arbitrary commands via StdioClientTransport by using the 'x-request-from: internal' header. When FLOWISE_USERNAME and FLOWISE_PASSWORD are not configured, the exploit works unauthenticated. If Basic Auth is enabled, the FLOWISE_USERNAME and FLOWISE_PASSWORD options must be set to provide credentials.",
