    "Description": "This module scans for vulnerable N-able N-Central instances affected by CVE-2025-9316 (Unauthenticated Session Bypass) and CVE-2025-11700 (XXE). The module attempts to exploit CVE-2025-9316 by sending a sessionHello SOAP request to the ServerMMS endpoint with various appliance IDs to obtain an unauthenticated session. If successful, it then tests for CVE-2025-11700 by writing an XXE payload file and triggering it via importServiceTemplateFromFile. Files of interest that can be read via XXE: - /opt/nable/var/ncsai/etc/ncbackup.conf - /var/opt/n-central/tmp/ncbackup/ncbackup.bin (PostgreSQL dump) - /opt/nable/etc/keystore.bcfks (encrypted keystore) - /opt/nable/etc/masterPassword (keystore password) Affected versions: N-Central < 2025.4.0.9",
