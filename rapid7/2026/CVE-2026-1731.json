    "Description": "This exploit achieves unauthenticated remote code execution against BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access (PRA) and Remote Support (RS). It leverages three different vulnerabilities depending on the user-selected target. The default target leverages CVE-2026-1731, a direct command injection affecting RS versions 25.3.1 and prior, and PRA versions 24.3.4 and prior. Alternatively, the module can leverage a chain of CVE-2025-1094 (SQL injection in PostgreSQL) and CVE-2024-12356 (argument injection), affecting RS and PRA versions 24.3.1 and prior. Exploitation occurs with the privileges of the site user of the targeted BeyondTrust product site.",
